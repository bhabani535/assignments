The CCB officers received a tip on Monday that a few persons would be travelling by a car carrying counterfeit notes near KR Puram.\\n\\nA senior police officer said, “A team was sent to KR Puram and surrounding areas. We got the registration number of the vehicle and also got to know that the vehicle was coming near A Narayanapura. The police went to the spot and spotted the vehicle. They intercepted the car and found that there were six persons in the vehicle.” The police found a bag containing huge amounts of cash. In another bag, there was “Rs 1.72 lakh cash which was brought to exchange with counterfeit notes”, the officer added.\\n\\nThe police said the money was brought by Masood. It is suspected that he had come by train to the City and alighted at KR Puram railway station. He contacted the other persons who brought the original cash to exchange it with counterfeit notes. They were going by the car to an isolated place or a hotel room to exchange the money, the police added.\\n\\nDuring interrogation, it was found that Ali and Masood were in constant touch with Ishaq and Shah Nawaz, both lodged in Kolkata jail.

From Bangladesh, the fake currency was smuggled through the international border and reached some key players in West Bengal.\\n\\nThe money was being disbursed to various groups and circulated across the country. “It is also important to know how these notes were smuggled through the border, despite massive deployment of security personnel and screening of every vehicle and person.

But barely 10 buses come now, leading to a drastic increase in the footfall, according to sources in the KSRTC. Passengers and bus drivers blame each other for the state of affairs. Passengers say no bus comes to the station, drivers complain that few passengers make it their pick-up point. Munikrishna Swamy, a KSRTC driver, said drivers felt the bus stand was not located at an ideal place. “It takes more than an hour to reach Tin factory junction from here. To save time, buses from the KBS don’t come to the station.”\\n\\nOn their part, passengers prefer to board buses at the Tin Factory junction. “Private and APSRTC buses pick up passengers at that place. The KSRTC gets a few passengers. The higher authorities blame us for low occupancy. Hence, we too go to the Tin Factory junction to pick up passengers,” Swamy said.\\n\\nAnother driver, who didn’t want to be named, said, “Some buses come to the station to pick up passengers who have made reservations. But these days, conductors call up the passengers and ask them to come near the Tin Factory junction or Old Madras Road so that they can be picked up easily. It saves time.” As a result, the station has become more of a parking lot for APSRTC buses. “It is not being used for what it was actually meant for,” a KSRTC official said.\\n\\nK S Vishwanath, General Manager (Traffic), KSRTC, acknowledged that drivers are reluctant to go the station to avoid congestion. “Then they think it’s too far from the Tin Factory junction. We’ll take up the matter with senior officials to find a solution to attract more passengers and ensure buses come to the bus station,” he said.',\n",

       "  'The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the latest party to make the claim that it was a party with a difference, has in a short period proved that it is made of the same stuff that all other parties are made of, and its leadership is no different from that of others. The events of the last few weeks, culminating in the expulsion of two founder leaders – Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan – from important positions in the party, have falsified all its past promises. It had claimed transparency in decision-making, clean electoral politics and inner party democracy. All these ideals were badly mauled and violated in the recent ugly public shows in the party. The top leadership has shown that it has no patience for dissent. Neither Yogendra Yadav nor Prashant Bhushan was given the opportunity to explain themselves before action was taken against them. That was not what was expected of a party which claimed to be open and democratic.\\n\\nParty supremo Arvind Kejriwal has reaffirmed his position and is now virtually the unquestioned leader. He told the party “to choose either me or them’’. The refusal to live with criticism and dissent, the positing of “me” against “them”, and the threat to quit if “my’’ way is not allowed are typical of the leadership style that marks all parties now. Yogendra Yadav has called it a ‘Stalinist purge’. It was certainly a purge, though bloodless. It is not just some dissenting leaders who have been purged. It was an ideological clean-up too. In fact, the party does not articulate any ideology. It claimed to be a platform against corruption. A political party cannot just be a one-point platform. Even this claim has come under stress with allegations of offer of inducements to Congress MLAs in 2013 for their support and other kinds of unethical conduct. When it was charged that party tickets were given to people with shady backgrounds, Kejriwal denied it, and said the criterion was winnability. Does that make it any different from other parties?\\n\\nThe AAP and its government are the same now. The same faces are there in the party’s top level committees and in its ministerial positions. This is not good for the health of the party. Large numbers of people had put their hopes and faith in the AAP. Many young people had left their jobs and vocations to work for it. Their idealism has been betrayed and a cynical view of politics will again prevail. The AAP may have come of age, but an experiment in good politics may have failed too.',\n",
       "  'The purported suicide by IAS officer D K Ravi is once again a grim reminder of the diminishing health of the society we live in, where this mode of death is occurring with uneasy regularity. We read and hear about suicides almost every day as seemingly commonplace occurrences. Yet, for the family and close associates of the victim who are suddenly plunged into grief, time stands still. They inadvertently become as much the victims as the deceased, battling prolonged guilt, shame, distress and stigma.\\n\\nIn the last two decades, the global suicide rate has increased from 7.9 to 10.3 per 1,00,000 persons. The World Health Organisation reports that over half a million people die by suicide worldwide each year. India accounts for 33 per cent of this number, more than twice as that of China. According to the June 2012 edition of The Lancet, 1,87,000 estimated suicides occurred in India in 2010 alone. The actual figure may be far beyond this, since many go unreported.\\n\\nIn the case of Ravi, the widespread media and public attention and speculation it drew was quite understandable. It is undoubtedly perplexing considering the age of the victim and the profession he belonged to. Research reveals that globally, large proportions of suicides occur between the ages of 15 and 29 years when emotions can run riot and self development has not yet reached its peak.\\n\\nBut here was a man well past that vulnerable period of life. He also worked for a coveted Central administrative service that may have its share of stress and strain, as is true of any high end job, but the entitled power, prestige and perks are certainly compensations in great measure. Hence, the collective question – why a young, successful and powerful person with a bright future would resort to such a drastic action.\\n\\nWhile there is a great amount of uncertainty in predicting suicidal behaviour and also drawing a precise sketch of a potential victim, experts in the field have been able to identify various risk factors. Suicidal behaviour can be attributed to several complex interlacing factors. A combination of three broad factors may be responsible: neurobiological, situational and psychological.\\n\\nThe first may include brain dysfunction such as change in serotonin receptors, the second factor refers to distressing life events such as broken relationship, sudden loss of job, status or money or chronic illness. From the psychological standpoint, most of the suicide victims suffer from varying degrees of mental disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety, obsession, depression and hopelessness. Unfortunately, most often they go unrecognised and untreated.\\n\\nBesides, the role of personal disposition, attitude and belief system of the person cannot be emphasised enough.  People differ in the way they react to the same situation and event and also in the way they cope with them. For instance, depression is undoubtedly a significant factor in suicidal behaviour but then all depressed persons do not commit suicide. Similarly there are a large number of people who face similar adversities in life or even worse, but they sail through life without showing any such inclination.\\n\\nLack of self confidence\\nPeople at risk of suicide are less tough, lack self confidence, are less resilient, more sensitive to failure and rejection and seek constant recognition and gratification. Therefore, it is fallacious to point to a single circumstance preceding the death, terming it a precipitating factor.\\n\\nUsing a well tested technique called ‘Psychological Autopsy’, the causes of suicide in a particular case can be determined fairly well. Unlike routine police enquiry, it is a way of finding out what the person felt, thought and did before death, reconstituting the psycho-social environment of the victim. It involves meticulous collection of information from personal documents, medical and psychiatric reports, personal interviews with family friends and other close associates of the victim.\\n\\nIt essentially examines the mental state of the deceased and tries to decipher the trigger points. A wide range of information is revealed regarding the victim’s personal life, temperament, habits, lifestyle, interpersonal relationships, drug or alcohol use, stress reactions, medical and family history, any recent changes in behaviour and habits, etc. In the maze of gathered information, predominant reasons for suicides do not escape the expert eye.   \\n\\nPsychological Autopsies of suicide victims and survivors of attempted suicide have provided better understanding of the victim’s mind and the circumstances that may have led to it. Suicidal thoughts ought to have been brewing much before the actual incident possibly followed by several failed attempts. In most cases victims give out certain prior signals which need to be recognised as cry for help. They may repeatedly speak of death, afterlife or their worthlessness and may display typical symptoms found several Psychological Autopsies.\\n\\nRavi, as reports indicate, showed many of these signs and behaviour, which unfortunately went unheeded. If only close associates become aware and timely counselling and treatments are provided no life would be lost in such a tragic manner. \\n\\n(The writer is a psychologist and Director of Eudaimonic Centre for Positive Change and Wellbeing, Bengaluru)',\n",

       "  'It is a travesty of justice. The court has let off all the 16 policemen, belonging to the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) of Uttar Pradesh on the lack of evidence in the Hashimpura massacre of Muslims. It was dark and it was difficult to determine who from among the policemen fired at whom, says the court. Apparently, no real hard work was done to conduct the inquiry and fix responsibility. Yet, how were the 16 accused separated from the rest in the first instance? The five lanes where Muslims lived had no rear exit, so there was no escape route.\\n\\nThe army was also searching every house. Muslim men, old, young and children were coming on to the road with their hands raised. Women were on the rooftops, crying, begging the PAC to let go of their men. One top Army official has rightly demanded an inquiry.\\n\\nTrue, the court had to let off all the accused. The killings cannot, however, be wished away. Naturally, the people are appalled over the acquittal of the accused PAC personnel. The families of those killed feel let down because, if only the perpetrators had been punished, they would have got some sort of justice.\\n\\nBy letting off the accused, without ordering a fresh probe or taking the police to task, the court may have done anything but serving the ends of justice. The case is yet another example to testify that the police do not go whole hog in pursuing an inquiry when it comes to its own force’s involvement. If even after 28 years of investigation, the police have failed to produce before the court admissible evidence, it is time to reassess the effectiveness of police. The cover up is obvious. I wish the court had commented on that. \\n\\nGranted the law and order is a state’s responsibility under the constitution, but the Central government is equally responsible for peace in the country. It was incumbent upon New Delhi to have appointed an inquiry committee from its side so that the witnesses, who are telling the media their plight, can be asked to testify before it. The larger question that the Hashimpura episode has posed is the lack of recourse when the police drag their feet and when the accusing finger is directed at the force itself.\\n\\nThe overall control of the Union home ministry has not worked effectively. State chief ministers do not care even if the same party is ruling in the state as well as at the Centre. Reforms proposed by the Dharamveera Commission some 39 years ago are accumulating dust in the states which were asked to implement them.\\n\\nThe Commission’s main recommendation was that the states should have a supervisory body, including the leader of the opposition, to keep an eye on the appointments and transfers of officers from SHOs and above. However, the Commission’s sole motive was how to separate the state from politics.\\n\\nThe chief ministers did not agree to the proposal. Today, they interfere even in the appointment of a thana (police station) in charge. They want their own loyal officers in such positions so that they could make a telephone call to them directly, as they do, to influence the investigation of cases against the men of their party or even acquaintances.\\n\\nIt is too farcical an argument that the system is to blame. The system cannot override the wishes of people. In a democracy, it ultimately depends on the representatives they return to\\nthe state legislatures and parliament. However, no consensus emerges even there because the institutions have become politicised.\\n\\nThe judiciary is the only institution that still enjoys respect. If the police were put under its supervision, the force may act more independently than it is doing now. The police may find that the political interference is not there. It does amount to running away from\\nthe problem than finding a solution.\\n\\nBut in the prevailing political climate, there is little scope for anything working independently.\\nNew experiment needed. It is disconcerting that things have come to such a pass. Unfortunately, even by persisting with the status quo, the system is not functioning properly. A new experiment is required. The police force under the judiciary may turn out to be a better experiment with commitment than the options we have at present.\\n\\nThe Shah Commission, which went into the excesses of the emergency, came to the sad conclusion that the police had become an instrument of tyranny in the hands of rulers. The force carried out illegal orders and went out of the way to execute what the political masters wanted.\\n\\nThe same type of obedience is visible now that the details of the Babri Masjid destruction are coming out. The police were willingly cooperating with the Kalyan Singh government which, despite the Supreme Court’s order to maintain status quo, was determined to destroy the masjid. It is encouraging to see that the apex court has issued notices to the top leaders of the BJP like L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, to explain their involvement in the entire happening.\\n\\nThe BJP leaders would have to explain how, for months, they recruited kar sevaks, collected funds and carried out the destruction act at Ayodhya. It is sad that even after 23 years, there is no plausible explanation how the police were effete to enforce the law and order. True, the history of the PAC is too well known as it had come to be influenced by religion and even built temples at the thanas. There was not even a word of reprimand and it was obvious that the top brass itself was contaminated. But what good is salt if it has lost is flavour?',\n",

       "  'Summer has already begun its onslaught, increasing the necessity to stay cool, healthy and hydrated by drinking lots of water, juices and eating the right food. With a variety of seasonal vegetables available in the market, it is important to keep in mind which vegetable or fruit offers the maximum benefit to beat the heat.\\n\\nDr Sunita Tripathi, dietitian, Primus Super Speciality Hospital, says, “During summers there’s an abundance of fresh, delicious and healthy choices. Many summer fruits and vegetables are brimming with secret health benefits. Some of the best fruits are –\\xad lemon, coconut water, orange, amla, water melon, litchi and musk melon. These fruits help to keep the body hydrated and balanced in summers.”\\n\\nExplaining the benefits of each of these, Preeti Seth, nutritionist, Pachouli Spa & Wellness Centre, says, “Water melon is one of the best hydrating foods, containing 92 per cent water that not only quenches your thirst but also replenishes your body with essential nutrients. It keeps your body cool. One can have it in any form – as juice or as a whole fruit.”\\n\\n“Onion is another important vegetable. It is rich in ph-yto chemicals which give body the immunity to fight many diseases and disorders. It provides protection from heat stroke. One must consume raw onion with food to protect themselves from hot weather in summers,” she says.\\n\\nDuring summers, the water content in the body gets exhausted faster resulting in dehydration. To deal with this the good old ghiya (bottle gourd) comes in handy. Ghiya has a naturally cooling effect which keeps you refreshed in summer. “Ghiya juice is an excellent remedy for excessive thirst caused by diarrhoea, over consumption of fatty or fried foods. It can be used in the form of raitas and cooked vegetable,” mentions Seth.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, cucumber is an essential part of diet in summers. It contains 95 per cent water which can easily replenish the water loss from body in summer. It is a good source of vitamin B, C and K, copper, potassium and manganese. It can be incorporated in salads, raitas and as stuffing for sandwiches. Cucumber packs for face are very hydrating and release heat from the skin. It also provides relief from sunburns.\\n\\n“There is excess loss of nutrients like sodium and potassium from sweat. Therefore, coconut water is a good source of all these electrolytes, gives you instant energy and refreshes your senses. Coconut water can be taken in between the meals. The good potassium content also helps in weight loss,” adds Seth.',\n",

This is an excellent juice for detoxing as both grapefruit and oranges are powerhouses when it comes to cleansing the body.”\\n\\nMaster Aminder Singh, fitness expert at Anytime Fitness says, “A power-pack juice, post your workout can help you in building muscles. You can have fresh apple and orange juice with a few almonds. The protein in almonds help build and repair muscles. Plus, it balances your electrolytes and fluids and the natural sugar in fruits gives an instant boost.

The Egyptians offered small round cakes, marked with a representation of the horns of an ox, to the goddess of the moon. The Greeks and Romans had similar practices and the Saxons ate buns marked with a cross in honour of the goddess of light, Eostre, whose name was transferred to Easter. According to superstition, hot cross buns and loaves baked on Good Friday never went mouldy, and were sometimes kept as charms from one year to the next.”',\n",
       "  'A girl in class 10 writes “it feels really sad to know you all feel that women are inferior and not capable of doing anything”. Another girl writes “... but this world seems to suppress girls and dominate us, which is stupid”. Letters like these are part of an exhibition that aims to introduce visitors to what concerns these young girls.\\n\\nThe title of the exhibition comes from American author and poet Maya Angelou’s collection of poems And Still I Rise as it goes with its central theme: Raising awareness of gender discrimination and its impact on limiting opportunities for women worldwide.\\n\\nWhat makes the exhibition different is that it also features artwork inspired by the wri\\xad-\\nt\\xad\\xadings of girls aged 14-18 from countries like India, China, Britain and Mexico in which they openly address the many fears, insecurities and stereotypes that societies around the world are building.\\n\\nThe letters grew out of a workshop conducted by a Delhi-based charity, Creative Services Support Group (CSSG), which invited around 200 schoolgirls in the city to pen down their thoughts on how girls are perceived in society and their role in it.\\n\\nThe replies opened a Pandora’s Box of issues confro\\xadnting these young girls and provided a gateway to their minds. “We realised that writing is a cathartic activity for these girls and a way to explain the prejudice they face in the world. This workshop was received very well and the writing exercise was followed up in a few other countries as well,” CSSG president and exhibition co-curator Anand Kapoor told IANS.\\n\\n“The artwork reinforces the power of the written word and women’s empowerment across languages and cultural realms,” he added. The genesis of the exhibition lay in the intention of letting the world know what bothers girls at such a young age and how collective responsibility can shed the burden of this thought process.\\n\\nHence, these letters were shared with 16 artists from around the globe who were asked to interpret them in their own ways and transform them into artwork.\\n\\nThus, apart from 50 selected letters on view at the exhibition, works of artists from India, Germany, Spain, the US, Mexico and Britain are also on view.\\n\\nFor Kapoor, it was the absence of role models in the lives of these young girls that had led them to a paranoid world. To overcome this, the charity also shot a film that combines the voices of women from all walks of life and po\\xadints to the strength of a united voice that focuses on gender equality in the world.\\n\\nThe exhibition is on at Instituto Cervantes de Nueva, Hanuman Road till April 12 .',\n",

In this show we have tried juxtaposing them together so that the two can be viewed in unison and we have chosen artwork that speak the same language as our furniture,” she says. \\n\\nThe artists who are part of the show include Sudhir Tailang, Alka Raghuvanshi, Vilas Kulkarni, Shridhar Iyer, Partha Sengupta, Anita Kulkarni and Ranjit Singh.\\n\\nGoyal feels art has a universal language and can be experienced by all those who view it. “Given India’s vast history and culture of paintings dating back to cave paintings from Bhimbetka, they are an integral element to energise spaces, be it work arenas or home spaces. Art can either be a statement or can blend sympathetically with a room’s design and colour palette. It is a way of personalising a space,” says Goyal.\\n\\nThe artists featured in the show believe that the elements of paintings and furniture work in tandem to bestow a unique character to space. “Alka Raghuvanshi’s vibrant and metallic colours add grandeur to the space. Anita Kulkarni’s works showcase passionately flowing colours which break the monotony of straight lined walls. Manisha Gawade’s lingering and bold lines blended with sophisticated colours hold the viewers thoughts,” says Varsha Bansal, director of Gallery Stupa 18.\\n\\nSimilarly Shridhar Iyer’s elegance radiates energy and blends with the space wonderfully. Vilas Kulkarni unifies the traditional as well as modern to compliment the natural shades of the space. Sudhir Tailang’s pithy drawings are perfect for the study and coffee table area where one can ponder upon life experiences. Ranjeet Singh’s paintings capture the expression of children portrayed in bright hues. Partha Sengupta’s bold and expressive countenances are energetic and reflect people’s personality.\\n\\nThe exhibition is on view till April 7 from 10 am to 7 pm at Mobel Grace, Sultanpur.',\n",
       "  'In this ‘online’ age, it is not surprising to see a young girl recording the information required in a bio-data through a video rather than write in a document format. What surprises is that even veteran playwright Girish Karnad employs new-age technology and the directors adapting his script for stage, remain true to each word.\\n\\nWedding Album, the play penned by Karnad, inspires National School of Drama’s ex-faculty K S Rajendran enough to recreate the Kannada litterateur’s work for Delhi audience. Staged at the Sammukh Auditorium, NSD, over the last weekend, the play drew an impressive audience. There were at least two reasons for the huge turnout – the popularity of Karnad and free entry.\\n\\nThose present did get a taste of Karnad’s satire on the weddings in the urban middle-class families which face numerous ups and downs, yet come out successful. The credit of incorporating even the minutest detail of a wedding goes to Karnad, but that of representing the same on stage, remains with Rajendran and his co-director Medini Kelamane.\\n\\nThe narrative is set in a Saraswat Brahmin Nadkarni family and begins with the video bio-data of 22-year-old Vidula, the youngest daughter. She is shot by her brother Rohit for her prospective NRI groom. Their elder sister Hema, settled in Australia, joins in for the wedding celebrations soon. Along with them is their father – who lives his life remembering his dead brother, the mother who remains harrowed throughout and the domestic help, Radha bai, who adds a sub-plot to the tale.\\n\\nIn between the preparations for Vidula’s wedding, there are snapshots of the melodrama that takes place in almost every household. Comedy, therefore, is not infused in the play but evolves from real life occurrences such as the banter between the lady of the house and the housemaid; the elder sibling reprimanding the younger to work and the man of the house giving a philosophical take on every problem.\\n \\nThis ethos is portrayed well by the actors until the latter half of the play where the NRI boy Chandrakant gets to deliver a sermon on the modern America and culturally-rooted India. Rather than encapsulating this and other such elements, the directors go the entire length of staging each and every bit, thus making the play unnecessarily long.\\n\\nIt is captivating to see the real-life family drama switching from past to present and vice versa, in a slick manner. The quick change of scenes holds the audience throughout the two hour, ten minute-duration. But what stands out is Radha bai’s endearing act and Vidula’s alternating avatar.

The event will be held on April 5, 3:30 - 7 pm at Kailaso Farms, Vasant Kunj.\\n\\nSpeaking about the ‘condition’ (autism), Dr Deepak Gupta, Child and Adolescent psychiatrist and founder of Centre for Child and Adolescent Well (CCAW) says, “Every child with ASD is unique in his or her own way, an attitude that our society has to understand, acknowledge and appreciate.”\\n\\nIn developing nations like India, it is difficult to even find medical and other tests for diagnosis, let alone having accessible information on the problem. In lack of basic information, where even recognising ASD gets challenging, there is a prime need for raising awareness of ASD among the people.\\n\\nDr Gupta who has been in the profession for more than 17 years, mentions that out of all patients he sees, the “ASD cases have witnessed a sharp rise in recent times. Due to this reason, there must be enough awareness campaigns educating people about ASD, its early recognition and ways to deal with it.”\\n\\n“ASD is often treated with extreme social disapproval. It gets difficult for us to try and make the other person understand the condition of our child,” says a parent of child undergoing treatment for ASD.\\n\\nIn a bid to spread awareness and usher a new wave of vibrancy in how autism is understood, Centre of Child and Adolescent Well Being (CCAW) is presenting the third annual Autism Carnival: Celebrate Autism.\\n\\nThe aim is to inculcate new perspectives, which are far removed from medical jargon or formal medical conferences and are more understandable to general public, says Dr Gupta.\\n\\nPaediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, students and researchers in the field of autism will be joining hands to change the way autism is understood in this country. The Autism Carnival will open an expert panel for a live discussion with visitors.\\n\\nThe second series of ‘Autism and Beyond’, a unique parent information book will also be launched on the occasion. The artistic and creative side of children affected by ASD will be on display through mesmerising paintings and artwork made by them.\\n\\nThe event will be full of fun, frolic and diverse educational activities. Some of which include special talent shows, art and craft, games, and much more. Stalls offering information on treatments like special education, speech and language therapies along with occupational therapy and significant developments in the field of ASD, will also be set up for the benefit of visitors.\\n\\n‘Celebrate Autism’ promises not only a moment of excitement for children, but for parents and general public as well.\\n\\nThe cause get a further boost by eminent names from the fashion arena, Shantanu and Nikhil who will join the festivities for inauguration and prize distribution ceremony of a special talent show for kids under ASD.',\n",

It so happened that when I went to a mind-reader much later, he told me that a profession in hotel management will be my career choice. Since then, I have taken up the profession very seriously and don’t regret it till today.\\n \\nI did hotel management from Christ University. Towards the end of my second year, I received a scholarship to complete a culinary programme in France. In my first assignment there. I learnt how I can bring together my scientific temper and artistic abilities for food. The French approach to commercial patisserie and boulangerie arts changed my outlook.\\n\\nAfter coming back to India, I worked at different restaurants. I am also a bronze medalist in Bachelor of Hotel Management, Bangalore University, 2004 and have completed my MBA in Human Resources.\\n\\nI also finished a short course in ‘Chocolaterie and Sugar’ at the Academy of Pastry Arts, Malaysia. After my return, I specialised in commercial baking science and patisserie arts. Now, I am a teacher and an entrepreneur. Dabbling in two arenas in the industry has taught me certain valuable lessons like discipline and patience.\\n\\n I have understood the different aspects within of the culinary arts itself such as knowing the history and culture of a place through cuisines, understanding the importance of detail and the value of presentation, texture, colour and palate.\\n\\n Apart from lending my proficiency to the art and science of baking and confectionary as an educationist, I also have a vast experience in the industry that spans through a number of years.\\n\\nTesting the waters at various academies around the world and working with international bodies to develop curriculums have given me  a glimpse of  how the industry works. I love this industry because apart from  giving me my bread and butter, literally and figuratively, it has never put me down. Cooking and baking have become my habit and every single day proves to be a challenge.\\n\\n The industry, today, is a booming one and the approaches towards cuisines are becoming specialised. Today, students are seriously pursuing cooking and baking as a course rather than a hobby. People are appreciating the experience of eating, treating culinary art with respect and treating the industry as a wholesome experience.\\n\\nThe recipe that I am presenting, I owe to Chef Sebastian Frecol. It is the first recipe I learnt in Europe as part of my training.\\n\\n It was specially executed for Easter and was prepared for an Easter dinner.

The democracy of the net allows the audience to find your films rather than the film finding the audience,” Adajania told IANS.\\n\\nAdajania, who is in news for his over two-minute visual piece for Vogue My Choice on women's empowerment, noted that promotional activities for films will also be tweaked with the change in platform.\\n\\n“For Finding Fanny, we had to think about marketing it in a certain way so that the desired audiences would come to the theater; but online it’s different. If people are interested in Finding Fanny, they will search for it,” he added.\\n\\nHowever, the filmmaker, who has earlier helmed Cocktail and Being Cyrus, also pointed out that there is a need to explore all dimensions before diving into this format.\\n\\n“If you can figure how this model works out economically for the producer then that’s the way to go. The possibilities and opportunities are immense; we can make any story – there are so many options to explore in terms of formats and this is exciting.\\n\\n“I mean imagine watching your actors performing a one-act live, like a play, where the audience dictates the direction of the narrative.

       "  'Anti-tobacco crusaders are dissatisfied with the government’s decision to put on hold the new 85 per cent pictorial warnings on both sides of all tobacco products. Originally, this was supposed to come into effect from April 1 onwards.\\n\\nThe announcement has come as big setback to public health as it is contrary to the statement given by the Union Health Minister JP Nadda assuring that his ministry will keep to the deadline of April 1, to implement larger pictorial warnings on tobacco packets.\\n\\n“They are overlooking the overall impact on the illiterate and children. Any country which is serious about the socio-economic development of its citizens will not take unjustified one-sided decisions of this nature,” Alok Mukhopadhyay, chief executive, Voluntary Health Association of India said at a joint press conference. This was organised by Voluntary Health Association of India, Public Health Foundation of India, Hriday, Healis and Voice of Tobacco Victims at the Constitution Club of India, recently.\\n\\nNotably, the Health Ministry’s decision is based on a letter from the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, to ‘keep the notification implementation in abeyance’.\\n\\nIn his letter, the chairman of the committee, Dilip Gandhi, has recommended the delay, because “the impact of the notification on workers and manufacturers of the bidi/cigarette and tobacco industry in India and its financial impact as a whole on the revenue, needs to be examined”.\\n\\nDr P C Gupta, director, Healis-Sekhsaria Institute for Public Health, said, “The decision conveys that the high-level policy makers of India have little scientific competence. When the whole world has agreed on the health effects of tobacco, even the tobacco industry does not contest those conclusions and the MoHFW has already published numerous documents describing health effects, a demand for further study can only imply an unholy nexus.”\\n\\nExpressing her disappointment Lok Sabha, MP from Pune, Supriya Sule of Nationalist Congress Party  said, \"It is very disheartening to see that government has decided to delay its earlier decision of having bigger and stronger new pictorial health warnings. India demonstrated global leadership when it announced its new 85 per cent pictorial health warnings in October 2014.”\\n\\nFollowing the notification, India’s position jumped to second from 136 among 198 countries. Taking India’s cue, countries like Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, dramatically increased the size of their pictorial warnings to 90, 85 and 80 per cent respectively.\\n\\nInternational studies demonstrate that larger, pictorial warnings on tobacco products have a greater impact than text, as only labels and pictures, can be recognised by low literacy audiences and children — two vulnerable population groups. Effective pictorial warnings increase knowledge about risks associated with smoking and can decrease intention to smoke among adolescents, persuade smokers to quit, and keep ex-smokers from starting again.\\n\\n“Time and again, tobacco companies have made baseless arguments in their efforts to dilute strong pictorial hea\\xadlth warnings and delay their implementation. India must act fast to protect its people, especially youth, from the dangerous effects of tobacco use. Pictorial warnings are an effective way to communicate harm to those with poor literacy status,” said Dr Monika Arora, director, Health Promotion and Adjunct Associate Professor, Public Health Foundation of India.\\n\\nTobacco-related diseases kill about 2,500 Indians daily and over 10 lakh Indians every year. It is estimated that about 5,500 youth and children (as young as eight years old), initiate tobacco use daily. India has 12 crore tobacco users, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2009-2010.',\n",

Bheemaiah KK, however, decided to earn a living from these discarded pieces of wood.\\n\\n‘Bheemstyx’ is a unique start-up – most people don’t spend years curing and crafting sticks that are otherwise disregarded in an attempt to turn them into something beautiful and durable. Bheemaiah has, over time, progressed from crafting walking sticks to home decor sticks, gadget sticks, city walking sticks and more.\\n\\n“About a year ago, I found inspiration in a friend’s collection of hand-carved walking sticks; I had a though ‘I could make those and I could make them even better!’,” he says. Since then, the coffee planter from Coorg, who shuttles between Bengaluru and Madikeri, has spent a lot of time scavenging for different kinds of sticks. He says he doesn’t go in search of a particular kind of a stick but rather, “When I see a stick on the ground, I think what I can do with it. I never cut a tree to make the sticks.”\\n\\nBheemaiah has an altogether thorough process of making the sticks. He says he prefers hunting for sticks in summer and spring because then they are relatively dry and free from insect infestation. “The process is very time consuming because far more sticks are rejected than harvested because they are either too crooked, thin, thick or straight...there are a million reasons! When I get home, I first strip off the bark and allow the branch to dry in the sun for up to two weeks, while sealing the ends up to prevent splitting. Then I let it dry for a few more months before I decide what to do with them.” The sticks are then sanded, shaped, painted, accessorised and glamourised.\\n\\nThe sticks are unique because not only are they hand-carved but they are multi-purpose. Made from hardwood, there are country and deep river walking sticks that come with a compass or catapult attached to the head of the sticks. They also have rubber soles to give the user a sturdy grip. According to Bheemaiah, decorative sticks are becoming popular these days. “They are intricately made and look fashionable. I also provide sticks that provide support to the plants in a garden. Anyone who needs any kind of a stick, I deliver it.” What are his favourite sticks? “I always have a stick made from Rattan vine in my jeep – it’s like bamboo and very flexible. You can bend it and it will straight up.”\\n\\nHow does one look after a stick? “Don’t leave it in the sun for long periods of time as it will crack; store it in cool, shady spots. Oil it often but don’t soak it, and wipe the residue as it will become sticky,” advices Bheemaiah.',\n",

Luck favouring, I may well attend this celebration when almost simultaneously by a quirk of fate, my grandson Rohan will be attending his Harvard MBA graduation ceremony at the same venue.\\n\\nThe individual photograph was taken on the occasion of MBA graduation ceremony in 1957. In a class of nearly 600 students admitted to the MBA course at Harvard in  1955, I was the only student from India. It did not take much time for me to realise how inadequately equipped I was to face a new world with a vast cultural and culinary difference, more strikingly in the company of fellow students about 25 per cent of whom hailed from UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and the like! It appeared that the only advantage I had over some of these foreign students, was my familiarity with the English language, which also did not last long as soon many of them picked up the language remarkably.  In the midst of many six footers with robust frames, since I\\u2008was of small build, I was always intimidated by their imposing physical appearance.\\n\\nEven so, I found them all very friendly and considerate, although many of them seemed very ignorant about India and its people. For instance, for them it was inconceivable how a person could live only on vegetarian food all his life! They however realised how mistaken they were when it was pointed out to them that the elephant which is considered as the strongest animal in the world and the horse by whose power (HP) all the huge machineries are rated, are both vegetarians.\\n\\nThe result of my interaction with people with whom I came in contact during my long stay in USA, was a discovery of one self in terms of what huge difference the upbringing could make in perception and practices in all matters concerning life and profession. I was deeply impressed by the friendly nature of the people, their level of honesty, application and focus on things they were engaged in, their ability to listen intently and to clearly communicate verbally as well as in writing without causing offence, and above all by their commitment and dedication to their jobs or to the cause for which they were striving.\\n\\nWithout going into my nationality, religion, caste or creed which mattered a lot in India, despite my humble rural background, Harvard granted me admission and offered full financial assistance to the MBA course on the basis of my educational qualifications. What was indeed overwhelming was that the Dean of Admissions himself was there at the Boston Airport to receive me. He took me to the  school’s dormitory where a single fully furnished room with a refrigerator had been reserved for me. In order to make me feel all the more at home, I was invited to have dinner with the family where special homemade vegetarian food was served!

       "  'With actress Deepika Padukone coming out in the open about her bout of depression recently, many windows seem to have opened.\\u2008At least there are some who are now gathering courage to talk about how they have also gone through such episodes. However, there is still a vast majority who are living in denial or are not aware of the magnitude of this problem. \\n\\nDoctors in the City say that depression has various manifestations. It can strike just about anybody at any age. But many people fear talking about it or seeking help because of the social stigma attached to it.\\n\\nTasneem Nakhoda, a psychotherapist at the Tattva Counseling Centre in Koramangala, observes that sadness and depression are two different things and those affected with depression find it hard to carry on with a normal life. “Children and teenagers can experience depression due to genetic reasons, loss of a loved one, separation of parents and peer pressure. Adults can experience major depression with symptoms of low energy, low self-esteem and poor appetite. It can manifest as stress or irritability,” reasons Tasneem.\\n\\nThe recent crash of Germanwings, whose co-pilot was said to have been suffering from depression, has also thrown light on the issue.\\n\\nTasneem points out that getting effective treatment is crucial. “The sooner the treatment begins, sooner the person is likely to recover. The family must understand the kind of depression and seek appropriate treatment for the same,” she says. “They must develop skills and craft a personal self-care plan that includes positive lifestyle changes to relieve and prevent later bouts of depression,” she adds.\\n\\nIn recent times, there have been many cases of suicides happening among the young. This highlights the need to focus on the mental health of young people too. Mahesh Prasad, a counsellor, who visits schools and colleges, says youngsters who come for counselling for various reasons don’t want to come to terms with reality, “They don’t want to face facts. They hit rock bottom the moment we tell them the truth. They have to undergo a whole personality change which most people are not willing to do. Some are rebellious and don’t want change at first. It takes several rounds of counselling to get them to fall in line with the mode of treatment,” reasons Mahesh.\\n\\nDr Chittaranjan Andrade, professor and head, department of psychopharmacology, NIMHANS observes that everybody suffers from anxiety, depression, and other mood or behavioural disturbances. “To qualify as a psychiatric diagnosis, the symptoms must form a characteristic cluster and they must be out of proportion to the stress in duration and severity. They must cause distress to the person who is suffering or to the people in his or her environment,” he states. Dr Andrade adds, “There is usually disturbance of sleep and appetite. Attention, concentration, motivation, drive and work performance are impaired,” he states.   \\n\\nHe urges that the severe the depression, the more important it is for the patient to come in for treatment early. “Persons can deal with depression based on their innate coping capacities; the emotional and material support that they receive from family and friends,” he states.\\n\\nDr Roshan Jain, Senior Consultant – Psychiatry,\\nApollo Hospitals says depression among youngsters and professionals could also be related to work pressure and meeting tight deadlines. He thinks the first step towards fighting this is to strike a balance between work and home.\\n\\n“Stop carrying work home, and learn to prioritise life and work in equal measure. Most people are struggling to strike that delicate balance between work and home. This is causing a lot of anxiety and stress. Extended hours of work add to it all,” he states. \\n\\nHe observes that depression also affects quality time with family leading to discord and disruption in relationship. “I’ve noticed that a lot of young people have begun seeking help and are making efforts to understand the problem and get treatment for the same,” he sums up.',\n",

To this, he had replied in the negative. \"If he (Khan) had chosen to examine himself he would have been exposed in cross-examination, Gharat further argued.\\n\\nThe accused had in the beginning of the trial accepted that the vehicle was owned by him and was in his possession when the mishap occurred. Even at that stage he did not disclose that his driver Ashok Singh was driving the car at the relevant time, said Gharat.\\nSingh had told the sessions court last month that it was he was behind the wheel, and not the actor, at the time of the accident.\\n\\nThe prosecution has alleged that Khan did not have driving licence and was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident. Khan had denied both charges.\\n\\n\"It appears that he (Ashok Singh) is a \\'brought up\\' witness and as such his evidence cannot be accepted\", Gharat contended.\\n\\nThe prosecutor said police constable Ravindra Ptil, a complainant in the case and also bodyguard of Khan, had said in his statement about three persons occupying the car -- he (himself), accused Salman and his friend Kamaal.\\n\\nEven Patil had not mentioned about the fourth person, i.e Ashok Singh, as claimed by the actor, the prosecutor said.\\n\\nThe prosecutor said the theory of \"false implication\" put up by the accused is totally ruled out because victims who were injured in the mishap had testified that they had seen Khan getting down from the driver\\'s seat. Besides, the complainant was accompanying Khan when he was driving the car and allegedly ran over people sleeping outside a shop.\\n\"Both the complainant and victims are independent and impartial witnesses and their testimony should be accepted. It cannot be said that they were on inimical terms with Khan and hence they were falsely implicating him,\" said Gharat.\\n\\nHe said the evidence of Patil, who had died during the trial, should be accepted in toto.\\nReferring to Khan\\'s claim that Patil was dozing off when the mishap occurred, the prosecutor asked, \"How can that be so?. He was on night duty on that day and was accompanying the actor. He cannot sleep when he is on duty.\"\\n\\nThe prosecutor further argued that Khan had tried to reverse the evidence that had surfaced in the trial by saying that Patil was sleeping in the car when the mishap took place.\\n\\nGharat said the victims who were injured in the mishap, had described the incident. However, there could be variations or exaggerations in their narration because perception of every person is different than the others. Even Supreme Court has laid down such variations could happen because of different perceptions of witnesses.\\n\\nThe prosecution assailed the defence theory that the mishap had occurred due to a mechanical fault in Khan\\'s Land Cruiser Lexus and also because of tyre burst.\"That is not possible because the car is a high end sport utility vehicle and has a display panel indicator which gives alerts if any defects crop up. The car is a fully automatic power-loaded one which will not take it away from the road in case of mechanical failure,\" said the prosecutor.\\n\\nAssuming that there was a mechanical fault in the car and the accused while driving it had not seen the display panel indicator for defects which may have crept in, then his act amounts to rash and negligence which is an offence under Motor Vehicles act, Gharat argued.\\nThe arguments were inconclusive and would continue on April 6.The prosecution has examined more than 25 witnesses while the defence examined only one witness (apart from Salman Khan who is the accused) during the trial.\\n\\nA fresh trial started after the earlier judge, a magistrate, added the charge of the \\'culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\' which attracts a prison sentence up to ten years, and referred the case to the sessions court.\\n\\nThe earlier charge was \\'rash and negligent driving\\' for which the maximum jail term is two years.\\nThe prosecution examined witnesses to prove that before the mishap Salman had visited a bar with his friends, to substantiate the charge that he was drunk.It alleged that he did not have a driving licence at the time, which he got only in 2004. However, the actor argued that the licence he got in 2004 was not the first one obtained by him.\\n\\nBesides the charge of culpable homicide (section 304 part II), the actor is also facing charges of causing death of one person by negligent driving (sec 279), causing hurt to persons by act endangering personal safety (sec 337) and causing damage to property (sec 427) under the Indian Penal Code.\\n\\nHe is also facing charges under the Motor Vehicles Act (driving without licence), and Bombay Prohibition Act (driving after consuming liquor).',\n",

       "  'The newspapers had the sensational news – an upright IAS officer, D K Ravi, whose USP was that he had helped thousands of indigent and poor people in his IAS tenure, was found dead by unnatural means. On another page of the same day’s newspapers was the shocking news of the gang rape of an elderly nun who was known to always help the underprivileged.\\n\\nThis set me thinking: What kind of signals will the above news items send out to the young and not-so-young citizens? That it may not be necessary for one to be “good” since in the above two cases, the persons’ “goodness” did not work in their favour nor augur well for them? One only has to see cases where the good have paid with their lives. Former Princess Diana, the “Queen of Hearts”, for whom Elton John, who wrote the song, “Candle in the Wind”, also wrote, “She whispered to those in pain…now only the Heavens will call out her name.” Surely, with examples like these, one’s belief, faith and trust in God and humanity will be badly shaken and eroded. Does this, therefore, imply it is not really feasible to be good and one need not necessarily need to garner a “good disposition”? To answer this question, let me quote the following quotation attributed to Mother Teresa: “People are often unreasonable, illogical and self-centred/ Forgive them anyway/ If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives/ Be kind anyway/ The good you do today people will forget tomorrow/ Be good anyway…” From this quotation, one may infer that even though the best of one’s intentions may be misconstrued, one should remain staunch and unfazed and “be good anyway”.\\n\\nIn both the short run and long run, it would do one good to house principled behaviour and not do good merely for name, fame and adulation, nor should one do it for possible perks or incentives. One should not put on a feigned “holier than thou” perspective, nor be like a charlatan or hypocrite, pretending to be good, for these are traits that can be easily spotted out and detected. Instead, it is far more feasible for one to lay the foundation of one’s life with a sturdy base on which one can build the later edifice, strong and reliable. On many occasions, one turns absolutely ballistic on seeing some persons do a whole lot of heinous acts and appear to go scot-free and undetected. However, one should discern that whatever goes around comes around, too, and no act of acrimony, meanness or cheating ever goes unpunished. However, one should not think of “playing God” by retaliating and taking revenge. Most religions do believe that there is a “Day of Judgement” when everyone will get their due, either good or bad. One’s actions, thoughts, spoken words will be determined by God who will subsequently discern how one, despite detractors, was able to, as per Mother Teresa’s quotation, “be good anyway”.',\n",

Not being familiar with this city, I make it to the theatre just in time. As I drop into an empty seat just by the side door at the back, the lights dim and a man walks to the podium on the stage. He announces that the play is about to begin, gives us an overview and walks out.\\n\\nWe, the audience, wait in silent expectation as the curtains remain shut. We are told that the play is about an hour long and will have no break and are (curtly) asked to switch our phones off. The door to my immediate left opens and, in the darkness, I see a man being wheeled in by his assistant. The wheelchair is placed next to me and I can see the slumped silhouette of a senior citizen, his head half forward and cocked to one side, his mouth partly open. The man is dressed in a white kurta-pyjama.\\n\\nThe play begins. It is in Hindi and is a motley set of three charming short stories, each from a different context. I particularly like the one set in a train compartment – the context is common place, the language colloquial and the humour ready and simple. Somewhere in the middle though, I hear a gentle snore from my left, not loud enough to annoy, yet hardly soft enough to ignore. This person clearly did not pay the three hundred bucks I did! Even when he does not snore, he hardly seems to pay attention to the goings-on in front, his head half tilted and bent forward, the jaw dropping a bit, but I can see from the corner of my eye that he is trying to watch the play. I turn my attention to the stage.\\n\\nThere isn’t much of an audience in the theatre today, it being a weekday and the set of plays or the actors hardly being high-profile that would attract the high-brow, the type who would see ‘Waiting for Godot’ and then comment on the evolution of surrealism in expressed art, driving me into a panic. But today is different. Everyone understands this play and all of us sitting there cheer at just the right moments (except the sleeping old fellow, of course).\\n\\nWhen the final curtain falls, the audience stands up to applaud and the lights on stage come on. The actors appear and we applaud them. The experienced lady director takes her bow and thanks Prithvi Theatre for hosting the play. The lights brighten overhead and I glance to my left. It is then that I realise – after initial difficulty – that, for the last one hour, I have sat next to Shashi Kapoor.\\n\\nThis is not the image I had in mind of him: the awesomely handsome actor with an intelligent smile and expressive eyes who left his indelible mark on Indian cinema, and, in particular, blew me away with the intensity of his performance in Kalyug and the starkness of his role in Junoon, whose one minute – just that minute – in Ijaazat made all the difference. That is the Shashi Kapoor I know. Yet that image must accommodate change and time, for it is of the legend from an age long past, from the mists of childhood and adolescent memory, from the black-and-white, full-page adverts for new releases in the 1970s tabloid, from the fetching posters done by unknown, unsung artists.\\n\\nAs I reluctantly walk away from this figure in the wheelchair, now in the winter of his life, my thoughts are mired in shock and confusion. I am filled with admiration at his determination to stay with theatre, albeit as a anonymous, inconspicuous member of the audience.  Yet, his visage – the half-lidded eyes, the dropping chin, the unseeing eyes marked with disinterest, the head unsteady and the slumping posture – refuses to fade away.\\n\\nStill, I sat next to Shashi Kapoor for an hour. No man deserves the Dadasaheb Phalke award more than him.',\n",
       "  'Freedom of expression is under grave threat in Bangladesh again. Two bloggers have been killed in separate incidents on the streets of Dhaka over a span of five weeks for expressing views opposing religious fundamentalism. Silencing them was not the only aim of the assailants, who used machetes to murder their victims in the most gruesome manner. Clearly, their aim was to terrorise the larger population to shun adopting and airing progressive views. Bangladesh’s fundamentalists have used threats and violence to intimidate secular-democratic writers and activists in the past too. Death threats forced feminist writer Taslima Nasreen to flee abroad in the 1990s. In February 2013, an activist, who had participated in demonstrations demanding capital punishment for those convicted of war crimes during Bangladesh’s liberation war, was hacked to death in Dhaka. The growing frequency and brutality of attacks on secular minded people signals a sharp shrinking in Bangladesh’s democratic space.\\n\\nAlthough Bangladesh’s emergence as an independent state in 1971 marked the victory of secular democratic forces, religious fundamentalism was not fully defeated. In the decades since, fundamentalism gathered strength and momentum; extremist outfits have proliferated in the country. The battle between the forces of secularism and fundamentalism for control of Bangladeshi state and society, indeed for control over Bangladesh’s soul and Bangladeshi hearts, minds and way of life has accelerated in recent years. It is in the context of this secular-religious divide that the killing of secular writers must be seen.\\n\\nThe killings are an outcome too of Bangladesh’s violent political culture. Rivalry between the ruling Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has paralysed the functioning of parliament and undermined dialogue as a means of resolving differences. Instead of working towards compromise, parties and politicians unleash violence routinely; hundreds have been killed in opposition-led protests this year. The Sheikh Hasina government is preoccupied with crushing her political opponents rather than tackling rampant lawlessness and religious fundamentalism in the country which has penetrated state institutions and bigots are laying down the rules whether in politics or social life even as the government twiddles its thumbs. This is unfortunate as Bangladesh has been a diverse society. When religious fundamentalists call the shots, they strip culture and society of its vibrancy. This is the danger that looms over Bangladesh today. The Awami League government must act now not only to nab those behind the killings but also to protect freedom of speech and expression, and importantly to strengthen the politics of tolerance, compromise and dialogue in the country.',\n",

His efforts were rewarded when Daredevils bought him for a whopping Rs 16 crore in the auction in February. The 33-year-old batsman, who last played for India in a T20 match against Sri Lanka in April 2014, said he was in “good shape” and eager to carry his form to the Twenty20 league.\\n\\n“It\\'s been a couple of hard years for me since I have come back from my treatment (of cancer).

I want to take one step at a time, IPL is the first step. I will see how it goes from here,\" said the 36-year-old left-arm bowler, who had his last international stint in a Test match against New Zealand in February, 2014.\\n\\nBoth were happy to find themselves in the company of coach Gary Kirsten, who guided India to 2011 World Cup triumph.\"Gary is a very good coach.

The approach could have paid dividends as early as in the 13th minute when Sunil Chhetri miscued a header after right-back Anto found the India international close to the Sporting goal.\\n\\nThe miss could have proved costly as Sporting came close to drawing the first blood in the 19th minute. A well worked routine between Amhmoud Al Amana and Odafa Okolie set the latter within the sight of the goal. The Nigerian, who unleashed a thunderous strike from 20 yards, had his arms over his head as Bengaluru goalkeeper Lalthuammawia Ralte’s extending arm kept away the danger in style.\\n\\nThis was the closest the visitors could come to scoring and with withdrawal of their leading goal-scorer Antony Wolfe half-way into the first period, their hopes of finding a goal took a further dip.\\n\\nThe Mateus Costa-side faced more trouble through their lackluster defending, and it was no surprise when a defensive error paved the way for the first goal of the tie. Clemente Joseph left the referee with no choice but to blow for a free-kick as he brought down BFC skipper Chettri near the corner flag with a dangerous tackle.\\n\\nThe Blues made no mistake with the set-piece as Walker’s glancing header off a Eugenson Lyngdho free-kick flew into the top corner, sending a wave of cheer among the BFC faithful.\\n\\nIf the first one was a training ground routine, the second one was improvisation at its best. The move gathered pace as Chhetri set his strike partner Sean Rooney on a run with a delightful through ball on the right flank.\\n\\nThe Australian got past his man to find an unmarked Anto inside the penalty area who made no mistake in slotting home the second goal with ease.\\n\\nA lively Bengaluru then went on to wrap up the proceedings in style as they overpowered a depleted Sporting side to score two more before the final whistle.',\n",

For 3-4 months in a year you could play good competition and it did not cost a lot of money.

       "  \" Primary and Secondary Education Minister Kimmane Ratnakar on Tuesday said the State government would make it optional for all schools to teach Kannada as first, second or third language.\\n\\nReplying to a debate on the Kannada Language Learning Bill, 2015, the minister said that a provision would  be made in the bill to teach Kannada as the third language. The original bill provided that Kannada should be taught as first or second language from class 1 to 10 in a phased manner from the academic year 2015-16.  A suggestion to make Kannada as third option was made by BJP\\u2008MLA\\u2008Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri.\\n\\nSchools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE will not come under ambit of the bill. The minister said about 700 schools are affiliated to either CBSE or ICSE in the State. “We cannot bring these schools under the purview of the bill as they are governed and controlled by central board. But the government will explore the possibility of bringing them under the proposed legislation in future,” he stated.\\n\\nRatnakar, however, failed to give any assurance on taking action against schools that have violated the medium of instruction rules in the State. Though he said that these schools could be booked under various sections of IPC, he did not announce the government's stand in this regard. About 1,700 schools had taken permission from the government to impart education in Kannada medium, but are conducting classes in English medium, he said.\\n\\nDelegation to Centre\\n\\nBowing to pressure from opposition parties, CM Siddaramaiah said he will soon take a delegation to the Centre urging it to bring in the constitutional amendment on the medium of instruction issue. “I have already written to chief ministers of all southern states on the issue seeking their support. I will also raise the issue in the National Development Council meeting,” he said.\\n\\nWith the Supreme Court striking down the State's stand on the medium of instruction, bringing an amendment was a way out. Moreover, the court has held in the past the Parliament is supreme. So the government is confident that the amendment bill will stand the legal scrutiny, he added.\",\n",

       "  'All it took was less than 36 months to question the sanctity of the move to trifurcate the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). The decision to split the MCD, taken in 2012, has proved to be an utter disaster with two of the three corporations being in the red and left with not enough funds even to pay salaries to its employees.\\n\\nThe trifurcation of MCD (into South, East and North Corporations) was described as an ‘astute political move’ by the then Congress government to make inroads into the MCD, but now councillors say it was not at all in the public interest. They, as well as officials of the civic agencies, are now clamouring for reunification of the three corporations to extricate them from their financial troubles.  “The trifurcation was an illogical move because the number of zones under the three civic agencies remained the same as they were under the unified MCD – 12. Instead of the trifurcation of the unified MCD, the city government should have increased the number of zones for greater division of labour,” says a senior official with North Corporation requesting anonymity.\\n\\nExperts say that the trifurcation has led to increase in the expenditure for carrying out development work, but the delivery of services has not improved. Budget allocation of Rs 6,624 crore was made in 2011-12 for the unified MCD, and now the combined budget of the three corporations is over Rs 10,000 crore, adds the official. “The expenditure has risen by nearly Rs 4,000 crore but the revenue has not increased,” he adds. Under-performance of the civic agencies is one of the main causes for their present predicament, but there is no denying the fact that lack of funds from the city government has turned the situation from bad to worse.\\n\\nAt the time of trifurcation, the Delhi government had promised financial aid to civic agencies. But so far, it has only released Rs 326 crore — that too in the form of a loan with an 18 per cent interest. “We end up paying Rs 80 crore to Rs 90 crore as interest,” says an official with North Corporation. The Delhi government has not given funds to corporations for a long time. “Last year, the Delhi government promised to pay Rs 620 crore under the education sector to North Corporation, but later reduced it to Rs 450 crore. So, the allocation reduced by over Rs 150 crore,” he adds. “We were supposed to get Rs 302 crore as a share from taxes, but we haven’t got this amount,” he says.\\n\\nThe Delhi government departments are also giving civic bodies a hard time by conveniently evading property tax. In total, they owe Rs 86.91 crore as property tax and service charge to North Corporation, according to official figures. Property tax is the main source of revenue for civic agencies. It comprises parking charges, advertisements and licencing fee. While the North and East Corporations are pressed for cash, its South Delhi counterpart is self-sufficient in managing its financial health. The North Corporation has sought a Rs 100 crore-loan from the South Corporation as well.\\n\\nSome officials argue that the civic agencies should first put their house in order before laying the blame entirely on the Delhi government for paucity of funds. Not only have they been unable to bring more properties under the tax net, but they have even failed to generate revenue from advertisements, licencing, renting out banquet halls and community centres for social functions. There are over 10 lakh properties under the limits of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, of which only 3.5 lakh property owners pay the tax, says a senior official with the civic agency.\\n\\nProperty tax issue\\nThe East Corporation manages to earn property tax from 2.8 lakh properties out of 4.5 lakh properties in its areas. In their defence, the civic agencies claim they also provide services like sanitation, education and health which do not serve as sources of revenue generation. “The corporations are left with limited sources of income as the Delhi government has taken over roads (over 60 feet wide), slum department, rural development, development of unauthorised colonies, Delhi Jal Board and fire department,” says the official.\\n\\nCivic agencies demand that some of these responsibilities which were taken away by the Delhi government be given back to them and also the latter should give grants in aid to carry out these functions. Chairman of South Delhi Municipal Corporation Subhash Arya says, “These functions belong to the civic agencies according to the 74th Amendment that strengthens local governance in the country.”\\n\\nArya points out that transfer of services as a result of the trifurcation has weakened the corporations financially. “Now there is a new government in city. It should work to strengthen the corporations by giving them back the responsibilities which form their core functions,” adds Arya. He considers reunification of the civic agencies as the only way out.\\n\\nCiting that the city government itself is short of funds, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has asked the civic agencies to seek funds from the Centre. This has irked councillors of all the three corporations. “When we had gone to meet the CM, he told us that we should ask our party for funds. We told him (Kejriwal) that we have come to the CM as the leaders of civic agencies for financial aid. You should act like a CM and not like a member of a party,” says Leader of House in East Delhi Municipal Corporation Ram Narayan Dubey. “How are we supposed to carry out our obligatory functions without being able to pay the employees,” he adds.',\n",
       "  'There have been protests by several organisations of fishermen, including those of deep-sea artisanal fisher folk in several coastal states against the recommendations of an expert committee that reviewed India’s marine fishing policy and the existing guidelines for deep-sea fishing in the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\\n\\nThe Union agriculture ministry’s Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (DAHD&F), through an order on August 1, 2013 constituted an expert committee under the chairpersonship of the B Meenkumari, Deputy Director General (Fisheries), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), for a comprehensive review of deep sea fishing policy and guidelines. The committee submitted its report in August 2014.\\n\\nAfter declaration of the EEZ in 1976, the oceanic resources available to India are estimated at 2.02 million sq km, comprising 0.86 million sq km (42.6 per cent of the total) on the west coast, 0.56 million sq km (27.7 per cent) on the east coast and 0.60 million sq km (29.7 per cent) around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\\n\\nThe continental shelf area amounts to 5,30,000 sq km of which 71 per cent area is available in the Arabian Sea (west coast) and the remaining 29 per cent in the Bay of Bengal (east coast). With the absolute right on the EEZ, India has also acquired the responsibility to conserve, develop and optimally exploit the marine living resources within this area.\\n\\nThe expert committee after considering  the latest resource potential of the Indian EEZ, which is estimated at 4.41 million metric tonnes, made some crucial recommendations towards full exploitation of the catch potential. It said that production in India from the near-shore waters has plateaued and that there is very little possibility for increasing production in waters up to a depth of 200 metre. But waters beyond a depth of 500 m are not optimally exploited, and there is substantial scope of expansion in this zone, mainly for tuna and tuna-like species, which are in demand in the international market.\\n\\nA most controversial recommendation is the creation of a buffer zone between the near-shore and offshore regions (waters between 200 m and 500 m in depth) along the coast and to regulate fishing there in order to augment resources in the near-shore areas as well as the deep-sea regions in the EEZ. Yet another suggestion is to throw open off-shore regions for fishing by foreign and joint venture companies (a suggestion that was rejected by an expert committee in 1996) until the domestic fishers acquired the capability and techniques for effective deep-sea fishing.\\n\\nBased on the resource potential of tuna and tuna like resources and other commercial species such as squids, it was recommended that a fleet size of 1178 Deep Sea Fishing Vessels (DSFVs) may be considered for deployment in the Indian EEZ.\\n\\nThis includes the existing DSFVs and the additional numbers of 270 vessels (240 tuna long liners, 15 purse seiners and 15 squid jiggers). In the absence of trained domestic crew that can work on such DSFVs, engagement of foreign crew onboard DSFVs was recommended.\\n\\nChanging composition\\nOther contentious matters are that in view of the changing fisheries composition, present modes of traditional exploitation of fishes is to be replaced by high capacity vessels and since the spawning seasons of tuna species such (yellow fin and big eye) do not coincide with the period of the ‘uniform ban on fishing’ implemented by the Government of India every year; a review of this ban period for the DSFVs, exemption of such vessels from the purview of the ban and a  single window clearance procedure for regulating the activities of the DSFVs.\\n\\nSpeaking at the 86th Foundation Day and Award Ceremony of the ICAR in New Delhi on July 29, 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi voiced the need for ‘Blue Revolution’ in the country. He called upon the practitioners of fisheries and aquaculture to usher in ‘Blue Revolution’ by sustainable exploitation of the fisheries wealth from the marine and other aquatic resources of the country.\\n\\nThe Meenkumari committee report may usher in this revolution. But its implementation will adversely affect the livelihood of our poor fishermen and lead to their displacement. It is a paradox that the report which compromises on intergenerational equity and promotes large scale exploitation of our marine wealth ends by quoting Prof Arvid Pardo, the Maltese diplomat and scholar who while guiding the debate on the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea in the late 1950s had convinced the global community that the oceans are the ‘common heritage of mankind’.\\n\\n(The writer teaches at Christ University, Bengaluru)',\n",

They are still on a brand-building spree here and are a niche brand of good quality products, he said. Even so, global brands have innovative packaging and advertisements that pull up their market share. But, the brands are not recognised by a majority of the Indian population, he added.\\n\\nTalking about the merger, he said that unless the products by the new brand appeals to the Indian palate, they would not make inroads into the market. “They have to localise the products, only then will their market share increase,” he added.    \\n \\nHowever, Brand Union Managing Director Arvind Hegde said, once the new brand enters the market, it would grow rapidly because people here enjoy premium, lifestyle foods.\\n“Kraft and Heinz are powerhouses. They are innovative and would increase their product range to suit the local tongues, just like many other foreign brands. A late entry is not a problem for such huge companies,” Hegde said.\\n\\nAccording to a release by the new company, it will have revenues of approximately $28 billion with eight over $1-billion brands and five brands between $500 million-$1 billion.\\nDH\\u2008News Service',\n",

       "  'No one other than Karnataka’s legislators would be happy with the hefty increase in salary and\\nallowances secured by them this week. The increase is about 75 per cent of their present remuneration and perks, and would cost the exchequer about Rs 47.5 crore. Salaries and all allowances relating to travel, daily expenditure and telephone use have been increased. Ministers’ special allowances got a big jump. Such a huge increase is unreasonable and unjustifiable even for a government which can afford to squander money. There are a few legislators in the state who\\nare indigent and who need state support, but most others are crorepatis and the salary does not account for even a small part of their income. The financial position of a person who holds a job or public office is admittedly no criterion in fixing salaries.But no one would agree that the legislators have deserved or have earned the hike they have given themselves.\\n\\nThe strange and unusual aspect of the fixing of the legislators’ salary is that the decisions are taken by the legislators themselves, both at the Centre and in the states. Since they benefit from their own decisions, there is a serious conflict of interest here. In the case of government employees, pay commissions take decisions on salary revision based on many norms and criteria. No one knows if any norms are followed in deciding the salaries of legislators. In many countries, there are independent authorities which determine the salaries of the legislators. In some others, they are pegged to the salaries of certain levels of public employment or linked to indices. In India also, there was a suggestion in parliament some years ago when MPs’ salaries were discussed that an independent commission should be set up to decide them. The government accepted it but no action was taken to follow it up.\\n\\nEveryone agrees that MPs and MLAs should be paid fairly and compensated fully for the work they are expected to do. Adequate remuneration is needed to ensure the independence of legislators and to attract people to legislative work. But the reality is that most are attracted to it for the power and undue privileges that go with it, whatever the salary is. Most of them don’t take their responsibilities seriously as the poor attendance in legislatures and the disruption of sessions show. Most of them do not care for their constituencies. Therefore, the periodic and hefty increases in salaries and perks would only be seen as waste of public money. They also show that there is no limit to greed and the urge to grab.',\n",
       "  'The Congress government in Karnataka has taken a page from the statute book of the BJP government in Gujarat to enforce compulsory voting in gram panchayat elections. The state legislature has passed a bill introduced by panchayat raj minister H K Patil for this. The Congress had opposed the bill in Gujarat from 2009, but chief minister Siddaramaiah and his government seem to have a different view.  Gujarat’s former governor, Kamla Benewal, had refused to give assent to the bill more than once on the ground that forcing voters to vote is ‘’against the principles of individual liberty’’. Benewal’s objection to the bill was right. Compulsory voting is a contradiction in terms and in essence in a democratic set-up. The right to vote is derived from the right to expression. Just as the right to expression also gives the citizen the right not to speak, the right to vote should mean the right not to vote too.  A voter makes a conscious decision how to express his freedom, and the state has no right and power to force him on that. Compulsory vote is wrong in principle, bad in practice and difficult to be implemented.\\n\\nOnly very few countries have made voting compulsory. Even in some of them, the trend now is not to enforce the provisions of the mandate. People have different reasons for and perceptions about voting, or not voting. They should be respected as a part of the democratic process.  Migrant populations, faulty voters’ lists and election boycott calls by extremist groups are some factors that make implementation of the law difficult. The government is not in a position to create conducive conditions for hundred per cent voting in all wards. Voter apathy is cited as a reason to justify compulsory voting. But in India, polling percentages have been increasing from election to election. Hundred per cent voting cannot also be thought of as increasing the legitimacy of the electoral outcome. Some studies have shown that it sometimes distorts the outcome, by giving an advantage to ruling parties or the candidate whose name comes first on the list. \\n\\nThe Representation of the People Act clearly says that the right to vote ‘’includes the right not to vote’’ too. The presence of NOTA in the ballot paper does not solve the problem with the provision. The Election Commission is also not happy with the idea of compulsory voting. The law has not prescribed any penalty for not voting, but still it is an unwise and misconceived legislation. Governor Vajubhai Vala should now withhold assent to the bill and return it to the legislature for reconsideration.',\n",
       "  \"It is said that a country’s well being is judged by the status of its weakest citizens. The weakest and the most vulnerable are the youngest and the oldest in any country. If they suffer hardships like poor health, poor nutrition and poor access to the basic amenities of life, not all the high tech progress in terms of industries, transport or communication has any meaning or relevance.\\n\\nWe may have the best of highways connecting cities and states, or the best of institutions both scientific and cultural. Yet, none of these can compensate the deprivations faced by children and those who have reached their second childhood. Their needs do not require enormous resources. They require concern and compassion above everything else.\\n\\nAt a very ordinary level, they require amenities that will make their day to day living tolerable. Infants need extra nourishment in their growing years. Or, extra protection against diseases. All that is required are governments which ensure the food that is meant for them is not siphoned off elsewhere. Or, medicines meant for expectant mothers reach them on time.A recent study by Unicef reveals that nearly 50 per cent of the under-five population in this country is underweight\\n\\nand undernourished. What more, nearly three-quarters of the world's underweight children – 51 million – live in India. According to the Unicef report, there is only a small improvement in the number of undernourished children here despite several feeding programmes by governments and NGOs. This can mean either of two things. Either the food is diverted to other sources or its quality itself is suspect.\\n\\nIn fact, corrupt practices among politicians, bureaucrats and social workers are known to be one of the chief reasons for malnutrition among the under five children in India. Malnutrition not only stunts their mental and physical growth. It is said to contribute to a vicious cycle of poverty and further deprivation. It hurts the country’s youngest citizens in innumerable ways. First of all, it reduces their immunity to ward off serious infections. If 5,000 infants die every day to preventable diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia, it points to a sad lack of basic healthcare. Hygiene, proper diet and vaccination alone could have prevented these deaths.\\n\\nAll three are beyond the reach of these children who live and die in insanitary surroundings with no proper nutrition or medicare. How many parents can afford the costly pneumococcal vaccine? Has the government made these easily available to the common man? As the WHO pointed out, India is “a country whose rapid economic growth and strong influx of trade and investment have failed to bring about a corresponding reduction of inequities in under-five mortality.”\\n\\nAs for the 100 million elder-ly citizens of this country (a figure that is predicted to rise to 323 million in another three decades) what is the quality of their lives? According to the United Nations Population Fund, the number of elders in this country will shoot up by 360 per cent between 2000 and 2050, and if the government does not frame policies now for their welfare, it is “likely to be taken by surprise” at the consequences of such growth.\\n\\nElders’ population growth\\n\\nIn other words, they will constitute 20 per cent of the total population. We do have a national policy for older persons. The government is aware of the dangerous trends. The National Commission on Population has predicted the rapid growth in this section which does not augur well for the country. There is even a constitutional provision for older persons and their well being. We must remember that the elder population, like the infant or child population, will need and consume resources rather than contribute to them.\\n\\nThey too need the same medical benefits, healthcare facilities and nutritional inputs. In addition, they will also need additional medical benefits as they are vulnerable to other age related medical problems like cataract, arthritis, diabetes and cancer, in addition to reduced mental and physical faculties. The ailments of the aged are numerous. Age related multiple disabilities not only need care but medical interventions that are costly and totally out of reach for the common citizen.\\n\\nTrue, the government has introduced a number of policies for them like free medicare in state hospitals, old age pensions, concessions in rail travel, subsidised foodgrain and many more. But, it must be remembered that many seniors – especially women – do not even take advantage of these schemes due to their low literacy/educational levels and lack of awareness.\\n\\nSo, until and unless we install a system where geriatric care becomes mandatory in all\\nhospitals, where public travel in trains and buses are more friendly, where there is easier access to safe roads and buildings with special facilities for the disabled in all public places –  where bureaucracy does not throttle pensioners and other aged citizens – we cannot claim to be a progressive nation. Unless our weakest citizens find their rightful place in society, such claims will ring a false note.\",\n",
       "  \"According to the reports of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation (MOSPI), India’s progress on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a mixed bag. MDGs were adopted by General Assembly of United Nations in year 2000 as a part of a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty. They constitute 8 goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators to be achieved by the end of 2015. \\n\\nAchievement of different countries varies significantly and ours is a mixed bag. For some indicators, like halving the percentage of population below the poverty line, India already achieved the target level. For some indicators, like ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education and tertiary education, India is expected to reach close to the target level by end 2015 if not actually meet the target level.\\n\\nBut, for rest of the Indicators such as share of women in wage employment in the non–agricultural sector, and proportion of population with access to improved sanitation, we are far from target. On the other hand, China has registered better results. One of the reasons for far-from-satisfactory performance of India is the structural limitations of concerned institutions. Now, international community is gearing towards post 2015 development agenda with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While MDGs were primarily focussed to enhance the basic quality of life in developing nations, SDGs encompass both developing and developed nations.\\n\\nDuring the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012, a new global development framework of SDGs was adopted to replace MDGs after 2015. This framework proposal contains 17 goals with 169 targets covering a broad range of sustainable development issues, including ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, making cities more sustainable, combating climate change, and protecting oceans and forests.\\n\\nThe goals are intended to advance sustainable development through greater integration of its three pillars: economic, social, and environmental. The SDGs are expected to be adopted formally at a United Nations Summit in September 2015 and come into play at the end of Dec 2015 as MDGs expire.\\n\\nA close observation of SDGs indicates that some indicators have more influence than others in the sense that proper management of that particular indicator will have impact on other parameters, for instance water resource. Water resources, per se, appear to be common thread for most of objectives, from ending poverty to achieve food security to healthy lives and so on. \\n\\nDeservingly, concern for water is expressed in Proposed Goal 6 –  Ensure availability and sustainable use of water and sanitation for all. The targets for this goal are by 2030, among others: improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping of chemicals and hazardous materials, doubling publicly operated wastewater and sludge treatment and increasing recycling and reuse globally. In this context, it is the role of the institutions that loom large for realisation of goals and in the context of water resources, it is Pollution Control Boards that need to deliver.\\n\\nOrganic pollution\\n\\nIndia has about 16 per cent of the world's population but as compared to only 4 per cent of its water resources. The annual per capita availability of renewable freshwater in the country has fallen from around 6042 cubic metre in 1947 to 1845 cubic metre in 2007. Given the projected increase in population by the end of 21st century, the per capita availability is likely to drop below 1000 cubic metres, leading to a situation that can be labelled as water scarcity.\\n\\nA Central Pollution Control Board study (2011) reported that in addition to total and faecal coliform which indicate the presence of pathogens in water, organic pollution continues to be the predominant pan-Indian pollutant of water resources, in other words, water resources becoming all the more scarce.\\n\\nThese shortages would be further aggravated by climate change, population growth,\\nirrigation requirements and industrialisation etc. The challenges of water resource management may be addressed through four broad approaches a) Improving efficiencies and minimising losses; b) Recharging groundwater aquifers; c) Abatement and treatment of water pollution; d) Reuse and recycling of wastewater. In this context, the organisation that is pivotal for this achievement are PCBs.\\n\\nHowever, ever since their establishment four decades back, these boards have been caught in dynamic stall with more of ‘policing’ and less of restoring the quality of water bodies. This ‘dynamic stall’ is best represented in the fact that despite every polluter adhering to the emission standards prescribed by the PCBs, quality of water resources across the country is deteriorating continuously.\\n\\nEquipped with concentration based standards, poor enforcement level etc, it is time for these PCBs to break their tortoise-shell and to lead path to ensure sustainability. Revamping the standards, at lease reasonable revision of standards that considers the health of receiving effluents should be the first step towards that direction.\\n\\n(The writer is associated with the Karnataka State Women’s University, Vijayapura, Karnataka)\",\n",

The consumption of diesel in the fishing boat per day crosses 500-600 litre.\\n\\nHowever, the government assures tax exemption to only 300 litre per day. The amount that would be credited to the bank account would end up in irregularity. He demanded that the amount would be deducted while purchasing the diesel as earlier.\\n\\nHe said initially the subsidy amount of the diesel would be deducted on purchase. The present plan wherein the amount would be directly credited to the bank accounts is a lapse.\\n\\nThe fishermen have to pay the amount and wait until the amount is credited to the bank accounts. It is absurd, as there is acute shortage of staff in the department and the process would end up in mess. There is at least shortage of 300 staffers in the fisheries department.\\n\\nThe present system was already in action prior to 2000 and fishermen had to struggle to get the amount. The assured amount was not credited to the account of the fishermen.\\n\\nThe UPA government had announced Rs 3 subsidy per litre of diesel in 2008. But the amount was not released to the fishermen owing to the complications in various procedures to be followed. Earlier the NDA government had announced Rs 1.50 subsidy for the diesel. State government has taken a hasty decision, he alleged. \\n\\nAs many as Rs 105 crore is earmarked for various programmes pertaining to the fishermen community in the budget presented recently by the State government.\\nHowever, the amount is of not much use, as the State government has failed to announce any sort of support prices for the fish catch, on the sidelines of the support price offered to the farmers for their growths. He claimed that the government should ensure special packages to the fishermen community who risk their lives.\\n\\nKidiyur alleged that the MLA Pramodh Madhwaraj had assured that the State government would opt to the earlier method of deducting the subsidy amount when the diesel is purchased from April 1. He demanded that the subsidy amount should be ensured at the delivery point.\\n\\nThe Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Fishermen Federation president Yashpal Suvarna said that the amount of diesel purchased would be recorded in the pass book given to the fishermen.\\n\\nThe record statements would reveal all facts avoiding inaccuracy.  In Malpe port around 50000 people are directly involved in the fishing business, while another seven lakh people are indirectly dependent on the fishing trade. The occupation has created immense employment opportunities and have ensured income source to unnumbered people. Despite all these unique features, the occupation has been the victim of the government’s lethargic attitude. The fishing business although is carried out only in three districts, it offers bright potentials to States treasury.\\n\\nThe indefinite symbolic protest would be held from 9.30 am to 12 noon every day until April 7.\\n\\nIf at all the Rajya Sabha MP Oscar Fernandez fails to hold talks with State government and comes out with fruitful outcome, the Association will take up rigorous protest in the aftermath.\\n\\nA meeting would be held by both district’s fishermen leaders on April 8 to decide over\\nfuture course of action, he added.',\n",

       "  'Breastfeeding has well established short-term benefits, but now, researchers have found that its advantages may persist into adulthood.Many studies of breastfeeding are confounded by social factors – in the United States, for example, people of higher socioeconomic status tend to breastfeed longer. But the population in this study covered a wide-ranging socioeconomic spectrum of women who breastfed.\\n\\nThe study, in the April issue of Lancet Global Health, began in 1982 with 5,914 newborns. The duration of breastfeeding and the age when the babies began eating solid foods was recorded. Thirty years later, researchers were able to interview and test 3,493 of the original group.\\n\\nAfter controlling for maternal education and smoking, family income, birth weight and other factors, they found that at age 30, compared with people who were breastfed for a month or less, those breastfed 12 months or more had higher IQ scores, more years of education and higher monthly incomes.\\n\\nStill, the authors acknowledge that this was an observational study, and that many other unmeasured factors could have influenced their results.“I don’t want to terrify people who did not breastfeed or who breastfed for a short time,” said the lead author, Bernardo Lessa Horta, an associate professor at the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil. “It isn’t only breastfeeding that affects IQ and income. But our study does show that breastfeeding is important and should be encouraged.”',\n",
       "  'It is seen that there has been a rising trend in C-section deliveries, especially in urban private practice. More number of women are now requesting doctors to perform an elective caesarean. The main reason for this is the fear of pain in normal deliveries.\\n\\nAlso, C-sections are made to look a lot more comfortable for women. However, experts agree that the best way to have a baby is through normal vaginal delivery. A vaginal delivery is the preferred route of birthing a baby for the following reasons:\\n\\nIt is the natural way of birth.\\n\\nSuch deliveries have no complications, unlike some associated with surgeries, like bleeding from the surgical site, injuries to organs like the bladder and bowel.\\n\\nThey are also not associated with post-operation pain and anaesthesia-related complications.\\n\\nBabies born of C-sections have a slightly increased incidence of respiratory distress compared with babies born out of normal deliveries.\\n\\nContinued effects\\n\\nIf a women undergoes C-section in the first pregnancy, her chances of a vaginal delivery reduces in the next pregnancy. However, Vaginal birth After Caesarean, or VBAC as it is generally called, can be successfully attempted, contrary to popular belief until some years ago.\\n\\nSeveral women with a primary C-section (C-section in the first pregnancy) can consider VBAC as an option. Doctors consider the history and clinical features of to-be mums and counsel them regarding VBAC. The incidence of scar ruptures during labour in VBAC is 0.1 to 0.5 percent, which means 99.5 percent of women undergoing VBAC may not have any complication.\\n\\nPain relief\\n\\nOften, a to-be mother’s biggest fear of vaginal delivery is because of the pain associated with it. However, there are a host of pain-relief options available today to assist in a relatively-easier labour.\\n\\nInstitutions conscious of a mother’s need to know all her options will encourage them to have a discussion with the labour analgesia team (the obstetrician, anaesthesiologist and physical therapist) before agreeing to accept a technique.\\n\\nDon’t let fear of pain misguide you. Make an informed decision. Unless there’s some medical reason, it’s best to opt for a vaginal delivery.\\n\\n(The author is consultant gynaecologist, The Nest, Fortis Hospitals, Bengaluru)',\n",
       "  'Many people often have doubts if homeopathy and allopathy medicines can be taken together. To which I say, homeopathy and allopathy are like twin sisters in healthcare. These are two ways of treating patients. They are actually complementary, and not contrary or competitive to each other.\\n\\nSome diseases are treated more effectively with allopathy, while some are treated better using homeopathy. The best doctor is one who is able to suggest which system of medicine will suit the patient in a given case and how homeopathy and allopathy can be used in combination to get the best of both systems.\\n\\nTwin benefits\\n\\nThere are many complex disease conditions such as cancer, HIV, diabetes, allergies, heart diseases, psychiatric diseases, low immunity and auto-immune diseases, which do not seem to find perfect cure in any single system of medicine. For example, cancer can be treated by surgery and chemotherapy, but not completely. Cancer pains may need additional therapy such as homeopathy.\\n\\nSimilarly, allergic conditions such as asthma can be the managed by inhaled cortisone or bronchodilators, but the frequency of attacks can be reduced by using homeopathy. Again, acute crisis of skin diseases like psoriasis and eczema would respond to allopathy, but long-term relapses are controlled with homeopathy.\\n\\nSo is there any harm in taking homeopathic medicine along with allopathic medicines? Not at all, if they are professionally coordinated. In fact, many studies are now done where both the medicines are given together for the treatment of some complex diseases.\\n\\nIn one interesting study done for the treatment of tuberculosis conducted by Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH, under AYUSH, New Delhi), it was observed that difficult diseases such as MDR-TB (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) responded better when homeopathic medicines were combined with the conventional allopathic medicines.\\n\\nDr R K Manchanda, Director General of CCRH and his team treated 120 cases of MDR-TB - some only with the conventional anti-tuberculosis medicine, while another group received additional homeopathic medicines as well. It was observed that those who also received homeopathic medicines responded better than the patients who received only allopathic\\nmedicine. This is a great example of complementing the role of homeopathy and allopathy in healthcare.\\n\\nThere are many recurring and chronic diseases such as asthma, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, neuralgias, osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, anxiety neurosis and eczema, which call for combination of both medicines. Although some people - including doctors of both systems - continue to believe that the medicines of different systems cannot be combined, the fact is that homeopathic and allopathic medicines are given simultaneously in some hospitals. Allopathic doctors also need to realise that both medicines can go hand in hand. Coordination by doctors from both systems is required. In fact, it is a patient’s right to ask for integration of both the medicines, if required.\\n\\nHomeopathy and allopathy are like mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, which go hand in hand in developing any gadget. The time has come that we integrate both the systems of medicine, allopathy and homeopathy, for various challenging diseases, because only monotherapy (single system) may not work in all patients. The doctors from both the systems must break their prescription routines and unite to help patients recover better.\\n\\n(The author is organising secretary, Global Homeopathy Foundation & director, Life Force)',\n",
       "  \"The Internet is full of food facts that, in reality, are just myths passed down from generation to generation. It can be tricky separating fact from the fiction, but we’ll give it a go.\\n\\nEating carrots willgive you night vision\\n\\nAs much as we’d all love to develop superpowers, it’s not going to happen by eating carrots. The myth came about during World War II, when rumours cropped up that British pilots had night vision powers, thanks to their healthy diet of carrots. Though the promise of night vision isn’t true, carrots do contain a healthy dose of Vitamin A, which is what your body uses to synthesise the pigment in your eyes that operates in low-light conditions.\\n\\nThis means that if you have Vitamin A deficiency, seeing in darker conditions may be more difficult. Eating carrots will rectify this, but only to the point of an average person’s vision.\\n\\nGum stays in your stomachfor seven years\\n\\n“Be careful, don’t swallow your gum, it’ll stay in your stomach for years.” This is a phrase many of us will be familiar with, having heard it from worried parents as we popped bubbles and loudly chewed our gum.\\n\\nFortunately, it’s nothing but a myth. The idea that any substance could sit in your stomach for years is a strange one: imagine the havoc it would wreak on your body. Any food substances we swallow are dissolved and excreted within days — with most foods dissolving within hours, and gum is not exempt.\\n\\nCarbohydrates makeyou gain weight\\n\\nWe all have a friend who swears by a “no carb diet,” but research shows that not all carbohydrates negatively impact your weight. The myth around carbohydrates causing weight gain is based around “refined carbohydrates” only. Refined carbohydrates can be found in foods like potatoes, pasta and white bread. Weight gain can occur if you combine fat and refined carbohydrates together as this causes an increase in blood sugar, and then insulin production, which can contribute to weight gain.\\n\\nComplex carbohydrates on the other hand, like legumes and whole grain bread, are excellent sources of energy and leave you feeling fuller for longer, meaning you eat less throughout the day. So don’t swear off the carbs completely, they’re not all bad.\\n\\nSugar makes children hyperactive\\n\\nAs much as you may swear that a slice of birthday cake sends your child on a sugar-induced flurry of bad behaviour, the science just doesn’t back it up. In 1994, a double-blind research study found that eating sugary foods didn’t affect the behaviour or cognitive skills of the children involved.\\n\\nAnother study found no link between sugar and hyperactivity and a study titled “Effects of sugar ingestion expectancies on mother-child interactions” found that parents were more likely to say their child was hyperactive even if the sugar they’d been given was a placebo. There's plenty of reasons not to let your child overdose on cakes, cookies and chocolates, but the phrase “sugar rush” isn't one of them.\\n\\n Crusts will give you curly hair\\n\\nOne of the stranger myths out there is the idea that eating crusts will make your hair curly. Whether or not you have curly or straight hair depends entirely on your genes. Eating a diet heavy in bread crusts - or any food for that matter - isn’t going to change your genetic makeup.\\n\\nThe exact origin of this bizarre myth is still unknown, though some believe it originated 300 years ago in Europe when curly hair was seen as a symbol of health and prosperity. Those who could afford to eat were generally healthier, so people began to believe bread and curly hair were related.\\n\\nEating cheese before bed will give you nightmares\\n\\nWe have Charles Dickens to blame for this one. In A Christmas Carol, a still in-denial Scrooge blames the appearance of the ghosts on “eating a crumb of cheese” before going to bed. And just in case you weren't convinced, the British Cheese Board has tested out the theory and found no relation between eating cheese before bed and an increase in nightmares.\\n\\nWhite chocolate is chocolate\\n\\nMany of us will have spent our whole lives believing the sweet creamy bars of heaven otherwise known as white chocolate are actually chocolate. We were wrong. To be classified as chocolate, a product has to contain cocoa solids or cocoa liquor. White “chocolate” on the other hand, contains cocoa butter instead. So why is it allowed to be called chocolate?\\n\\nThe European Union adopts a policy that states as long as it contains 20 percent cocoa butter, 14 percent total milk solids, 3.5 percent milk fat and has no more than 55 percent sugar content, you can label it white chocolate.\\n\\n Your steak leaks blood\\n\\nwhen you cut itIt’s easy to understand why many would jump to the conclusion that it’s blood oozing from your steak as you slice into it, but it's not. Almost all the blood in your meat is removed during the slaughter. The red liquid you find on your plate is actually just a lot of water mixed with a protein called myoglobin.\\n\\nYou need to drink eight glasses of water a dayThough staying hydrated is extremely important, you don’t need to glug down eight glasses of water a day.\\n\\nThe recommendation for drinking eight glasses of water a day came as health officials tried to match water requirements to calories requirements, without considering how much water you already get from other foods throughout the day. In 2011, Margaret McCartney, a Glasgow GP, said the eight glasses a day recommendation was “not only nonsense, but thoroughly debunked nonsense”.\",\n",

       "  'Summer is the season when you have to take special care of your skin. You may be surprised that the skin, which looked radiant throughout winter, suddenly looks dull, blemished and oily. This is because in winter the skin’s natural oils solidify, whereas in summer they flow freely.\\n\\nIt is estimated that 90 percent of wrinkles are caused due to exposure to sun. The sun’s ultraviolet rays, UVA and UVB, penetrate the deepest layers of skin, damaging the collagen - the spongy protein that gives skin its structure, firmness and elasticity.\\n\\nSo you have to ensure that you cleanse, tone and moisturise your skin on a regular basis. There is no better way than to pamper your skin with summer fruits, which are natural and free of toxins. Besides the fact that they hydrate and rejuvenate your skin, the very smell of a fruit on your face is quite refreshing.\\n\\nWatermelon\\n\\nWatermelons are not just a juicy summer treat, excellent for salads and weight watchers, they also have amazing qualities that can do wonders for the skin.\\n\\nWatermelons are good for exfoliation and are considered natural toners. They protect the skin from sun damage and moisturise it to make you look fresh and young. Here are some watermelon ‘recipes’ for a flawless, glowing and healthy complexion:\\n\\nTo get a cool, clean and young look, take one cup of watermelon pulp and apply it on your face and neck. Let it remain for 15 minutes and then rinse it off with cool water.\\n\\nTo remove sun tan, mix equal\\n\\nportions of watermelon and cucumber pulp mask on your face. It heals the sun burns and lightens your complexion.\\n\\nTo hydrate, heal and exfoliate your skin, mix watermelon juice and yogurt. Apply this pack on your face and neck. Leave it on for a minimum of 10 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water.\\n\\nTo prevent the signs of ageing, mix one tablespoon of watermelon juice with one tablespoon of mashed avocado. Apply this mixture on the face and neck, leave it on for about 20 minutes, and then wash it off with cold water.\\n\\nBanana\\n\\nBanana is an all-season fruit that is rich in nutrients including Vitamins A, B, C and E, along with minerals like potassium, zinc and iron. Banana helps in maintaining the natural and youthful glow of the skin. In summers, you can try these easy-to-make banana face masks at home to get that natural glow back on your face:\\n\\nMash half a ripe banana and mix it with one tablespoon of sandalwood powder or paste and half teaspoon of honey. Let it stay on your skin for 20-25 minutes and wash it with lukewarm water. This face mask is beneficial for oily skin as sandalwood helps in cleaning excess sebum and oil from the skin, while banana keeps the skin moisturised.\\n\\nMash a ripe banana. Mix in one teaspoon of milk powder and quarterteaspoon of honey. Apply to your face and neck; allow it to remain for 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water. This pack is especially good for dark skin that gets markedly grey or ashen due to the heat.\\n\\nMash one ripe banana and mix it with lemon juice (approximately two to three tablespoons). Leave it on for 25 minutes. This mask is full of Vitamin C, which will help in getting rid of the dullness and will help in reduction of spots and blemishes.\\n\\nMix one tablespoon of sugar in a mashed banana. Apply it on your skin and rub it in circular motions. Banana moisturises the dry skin, while sugar granules will help in exfoliating dead skin.\\n\\nThe moisturising property of banana can be used to get rid of cracked heels. All you need to do is mash the pulp of two ripe bananas and apply this pulp on clean, dry feet.\\n\\nTo get rid of dry hair and itchy scalp, take ripe bananas (best when over-ripe), three tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of yogurt and one tablespoon of milk (optional). Blend these ingredients thoroughly in a food processor or blender. An addition of coconut oil or olive oil can enhance this mixture. Rinse hair with warm water before you apply the mixture and lightly pat your hair to remove excess water.\\n\\nApply the mixture to the hair by massaging it onto your scalp. Wear a plastic cap after applying the mixture and leave it on for an hour or more. You can also cover your head with a towel after putting on the plastic cap for keeping the head warm. Shampoo it off and condition your hair accordingly.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nWhile there are ways to get your skin back to its original form, prevention is always better than cure.\\n\\nTo prevent wrinkles caused due to sunrays, stay out of the sun, especially between 10 am and 4 pm, when UV radiation is strongest.\\n\\nStay in the shade as much as possible. And wear protective clothing and plenty of sunscreen. Strive to apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before stepping outside.\\n\\nUse a sunscreen that offers protection against UVA and UVB rays. Choose a sunscreen with SPF 15 if you remain indoors and in case you need to go outside, do choose one that has SPF 30.\\n\\nSunscreen should always be reapplied after contact with water or after sweating. Put it on before you leave the house and reapply every two hours. Sunscreen also should be worn year round, every time you leave the house.\\n\\nLastly...\\n\\nMoisturisation is the most important part of daily skin care. Your skin needs more water than anything else and moisturisers are needed more in summer when you lose most of your body salts by sweating. Buy a water-based moisturiser and use it without fail. Make it a habit to wash your face gently with water a number of times in a day. Steam your face regularly to open the pores and clean your face of the dirt (five minutes for dry skin and 10 minutes if it is oily). Pat dry with tissue and moisturise.\\n\\n(The author is a beauty expert)',\n",
       "  'Hair spas are treatments for your hair that nourish and replenish them, restoring their healthy shine. Modern day pampering at its best, it does wonders for your hair and scalp, especially when your hair has been damaged from day-to-day distress.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the process of visiting a parlour and having a hair spa treatment done professionally can be rather time-consuming. And many of us simply do not have the time. Also, if your hair needs tending to on a regular basis, it can also become a very expensive affair.\\n\\n When hair undergoes multiple colour treatments, constant styling techniques and is exposed to polluted environments or even large amounts of strong sunlight, the outer cuticles of hair follicles may be damaged, which can cause noticeable degradation in the quality of your natural hair. Generally, when hair is exposed to chemicals, it can become weak and damaged, therefore becoming susceptible to split ends. Hair becomes malnourished, dry and brittle - to which there is no immediate fix.\\n\\nThe damaged hair requires multiple spa therapies to endorse healthier growth and repair. And doing a series of these hair spa treatment procedures at home is more feasible from both, a time and cost perspective.\\n\\nCombining the course of hair spa treatments you do at home with professional hair spas done by experts in salons is also recommended. A skilled hair technician will be able to assess the type of hair damage you have from a professional point of view and recommend the right products to use.\\n\\nBut of course, that shouldn’t stop you from trying out some remedial methods at home. The basic ingredients you require are oils - they could be coconut, olive or almond, as each of them has benefits and restorative properties. There are many lighter oils available in the market, like Moroccan oil or jojoba oil. Moroccan oil contains a lot of Vitamin E, omega 3 and 9 fatty acids and antioxidants, all of which help in treating damaged, dry, coarse or otherwise unmanageable hair. Jojoba oil makes the hair shiny, soft and elastic.\\n\\n Here’s how you could whip up a hair spa treatment in your very own home:\\n\\nApply lukewarm oil on your scalp and massage gently.\\n\\nAvoid massage in case of active hair loss as it can lead to further hair shedding. In such case, apply the oil softly.\\n\\n After oiling, take a hot towel treatment. Soak a towel in hot water, wring the towel dry and place the steaming towel on the scalp. If you have long hair, make sure the hair ends are tied up and oil is evenly applied before placing the towel.\\n\\nUse a head band to keep the oil from seeping onto your face. Take in steam five to seven times. Do this for about 12-15 minutes.\\n\\nn After the hot towel treatment, wait for around 15-20 minutes and then wash your hair with either lukewarm water in winter or tap water in summer. Apply a good conditioner after washing your hair for a perfect soft and shiny result.\\n\\nOne can invest in a small head steamer too (which is not very expensive), in case of regularly planned treatments. This facilitates even penetration of products in the scalp. The hair can be tied in a bun with ends facing upwards to ensure more steam absorption. There are professional spa products available in markets, which can be used along with a steamer.\\n\\nOccasionally, one can apply commercially available hair masks and serums instead of oils.\\nBut be warned, if not applied correctly, too much oiling and steam can lead to pimples on the forehead and at times, folliculitis in the scalp. Also, the irritation potential of any product increases when used in conjunction with steaming. So it is advised to have the condition of your scalp checked to make sure that you are using the right kind of products that suit your hair.\\n\\n(The author is dermatologist & co-founder, AK Clinics, Delhi)',\n",
       "  'The All India Chief Justices Conference is being held from today in New Delhi. It will take decisions on a number of crucial matters. The conference begins on a relaxed note as a result of Union law minister’s statement that as the new law of National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was under challenge, the courts can continue to make appointments under the collegium system.\\n\\nThis is a big relief because sometime earlier press reports had suggested that the government was taking the view that the appointments will have to be under the new legislation. That would have been unfortunate considering that of total of 895 posts in high courts, 265 are at present lying vacant.\\n\\nThis situation is horrendous and seems to be continuing because even in 2010, there were 200 vacancies of HC judges out of total of 895. The conference should make it clear where the real obstacle lies: in the HCs or the Supreme Court not recommending the names or the government delaying the appointments. The court could put all this information on the website and update it regularly so as to enable people to find where fault lies.\\n\\nOne innovation collegiums must follow now is to publicise the names of persons who are being recommended for appointment. One grave objection raised by the Bar is the utter secrecy that is adopted in considering the names (though in actual practice, the Bar comes to know about the inside deliberations even before the minutes of the collegium meetings are circulated). But that is no substitute for making the procedure formal and openly sanctified.\\n\\nAll that it requires is that Chief Justices should circulate these names to the HC and SC Bar Associations to invite their comments before finally sending the same to the authorities concerned. In the matter of SC  appointments, the information needs be sent to all Bar Associations but about HC judges, the High Court Bar Association concerned would suffice. Once that is done, suggestions of closed private confabulations within the collegiums (a charge which I believe is an overreaction), will not be made.\\n\\nAnother gravely mistaken policy is the appointment of Chief Justices from outside the state concerned. I have never understood the logic or the rationality of this practice which is a sure recipe for weakening the inherent strength of the judiciary. I believe that at the conference held in 2002, it was resolved that the policy of having outside CJs be discontinued. Later on, however, the SC collegiums yielded to the government suggestion.\\n\\nI have also never understood the logic of transferring the senior most judge whose turn has come to head the court in which he has worked for almost 10 to 15 years and with the functioning of which and also the lower judiciary he is most familiar with. To transfer him out of the state to a new court for a period of one or two years to which he is a total stranger, most likely not even knowing the names of his colleagues, is a strange concept of advancing the administration of justice.\\n\\nThe most adverse telling effect will be on the lower judiciary. They are to be appraised every year by the full HC. There are hundreds of them in each state. The full court is expected to jointly supervise their work and give them their assessments for the purpose of promotion. The outside Chief Justice will be totally unfamiliar with their work. How does he evaluate them?  The usual course adopted is to take the advice of some of his colleagues. He cannot get any feedback from the local lawyers because he would not be so informal with them. Is that fair to the lower judiciary? Why are we bent on creating this morass – as if the judiciary is not already under serious attack already.\\n\\nRetiring age\\n\\nNo one has suggested that an IAS officer, when his turn comes to be the chief secretary in his parent state, should be appointed outside. Why this gratuitous insult to the local CJ? At present, one has the embarrassing spectacle of a CJ on transfer being sent to a state whose language is not even understood by him.\\n\\nThe conference must boldly take up the question of retiring ages of HC and SC judges. There has long been a demand by public that the age of retirement should be raised to 70. There are no physical or mental weaknesses or less agility attributed to this age.\\n\\nAs it is, there are a number of tribunals to which Supreme Court judges are appointed. Their age of retirement is 68 or 70. I can not conceive any logical reason not to increase similarly the ages of high court or Supreme Court. As this will take time because it requires constitutional amendment, let the retiring judges be continued as ad hoc judges till the vacancies is filled up after amendments of raising of age.\\n\\nIncrease in the age of high court judges will also widen the field of selection. As present, successful lawyers in the age group of 50-55 are reluctant to accept judgeship because of early age of retirement. This obstacle will be removed permitting more experienced lawyers to accept judgeship. Members of the Bar will have no objection because it will apply uniformly to all.

       "  'Call it fortuitous or a concatenation of circumstances, the Indian nation at the time of independence was visualised as a secular entity. Not leaving anything to chance, secularity was firmly implanted into the Indian Constitution. Nearly seven decades have passed and the country should have been grappling with extant challenges like eliminating poverty, ending caste discrimination and removing illiteracy.\\n\\nInstead, in recent months there seems to be a choreographed attempt by sections in the government and those affiliated to it to water down the state’s secular credentials and give primacy to a religion-dominated discourse. Since the coming of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power in Delhi last May, hardly a week passes without communally-tinged assertions of one kind or the other from pro-Hindutva groups associated with the Sangh Parivar. \\n\\nIn social media and in public discourse there is an emergence of an aggressive lobby of Hindutva proponents who trash secularism and push for a militant brand of religion-led politics. The idea of a secular India is deep and in no immediate danger of being discarded. But, the trajectory of public discourse, even if by a small but raucous section, indicates an attempt to rake up imagined historical hurts against Hindus, perceived wrongs against the community and a much-trumpeted greatness of the Hindu religion, now ostensibly forgotten –  all with the aim of restoring primacy to the idea of a Hindu nation.\\n\\nIndia’s track record since Independence makes it clear that the country has been spared of much pain and instability and has, in fact, enjoyed communal harmony barring exceptions. What secularism has managed to do is make all religious groups feel as equal as anyone else. This has created considerable goodwill and helped stabilise the nation, unlike many other countries that became independent after the Second World War.\\n\\nWhere religion has dominated political discourse nations have suffered in consequence. Much of the current conflict in West Asia and North Africa – the Muslim world – has a religious underpinning. The complete erosion of secular politics in the region since the early ‘90s has exposed sectarian fault lines that have degenerated to a point where internecine conflicts have damaged social relations and ruined nations. \\n\\nCommon people have been trapped in a whirlpool of sectarian conflagration.  In countries like Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and across the region armed groups like the Islamic State, the al-Qaeda and the Salafists see themselves as protectors of the Sunni faith and are either battling the Shia or the federal governments. The Shia represented by the Houthi in Yemen or the Mahdi army in Iraq are fighting the Sunni groups and thus the vicious cycle continues. As a result, what were once vibrant societies are now enduring unimaginable suffering.\\n\\nThe sectarian politics in West Asia is far removed from the pan-Arab secular politics that dominated the region through the ‘60s until the end of the ‘80s. During that period, only the Arab identity mattered. Besides the dominant Sunni and Shia communities, this included Christians, various non-Sunni, non-Shia sects and even non-believers. Those were the heady days of secularism when there was much talk of a single Arab nation.\\n\\nIn India’s neighbourhood, the internal crisis  in Pakistan is largely an outcome of the Islamisation of the country during the period of President Zia-ul-Haq in the ‘80s.  Secular sections which dominated Pakistan has since given way to a religion-tinged discourse where sections of the Sunni see the Shia as rivals who deserve to be killed. Intolerance has reached a point where those who dare talk secular language have been assassinated, like Punjab governor Salman Taseer and others who opposed the nation’s blasphemy laws.\\n\\nHindutva in political discourse\\n\\nSimilarly, Bangladesh is grappling with a horrific rise in religious intolerance with at least three secular bloggers hacked to death. The Sangh Parivar including the ruling BJP needs to ask whether India too deserves to go the same way. Those who talk disparagingly of secularism are taking for granted its role in ensuring India’s stability.\\n\\nBringing back Hindutva to the centre of political discourse at the risk of alienating Muslims and Christians is an exercise in idiocy. Once damage is done to social relations it will take a long time, if at all, to set things right. India has only now barely recovered from the trauma of Partition riots. The anti-Sikh attacks of 1984 and the Gujarat communal conflagration in 2001 along with scores of other riots, though on a smaller scale, have shown that the beasts of communal violence lurk just below the surface.\\n\\nAlready, there are voices of resentment. The influential All India Muslim Personal Law Board has said the Modi government is making minority communities insecure. Someone like noted police officer Julio Ribeiro has expressed feeling alienated over the rising “proponents of the Hindu Rashtra”. Former naval chief Sushil Kumar has warned of communalisation of India’s military.\\n\\nThough it is beyond the government to constitutionally banish secularism, there are moves to effectively reduce it to a dead letter. The ban on cow slaughter and beef eating in Maharashtra with a threat to implement it across the country,  the constant attack on religious conversions and the introduction of Hindu sacred texts into educational curriculums in BJP-ruled states are attempts to Hinduise previously secular spaces. \\n\\nWhat makes the Hindutva project inexplicable is its raison détre. If there was a threat to Hindu religion, for instance, one could have understood moves to resurrect it. But, in the Indian scheme of things, secularism has never meant erosion of any religion, let alone Hinduism. Instead, secularism in India allows the space for each religion to flourish. This being the case, the attempts to thrust Hindutva over the others is fraught with danger for which this country is bound to pay a heavy price...unless saner counsel prevails.',\n",

Around 3,000 volunteers worked to put up an extravagant show that was ‘Revamp’, an annual inter-collegiate festival conducted by Reva University.\\n\\nThe fest can be described as one of the fascinating fests ever. It was a blend of fine arts, cultural, literary, management, and technical events along with a variety of other informal events.\\n\\nThe four-day event promised ample entertainment and enjoyment for all the students. It attracted thousands of visitors reaching a footfall of nearly 15,000 people. The theme of the fest was ‘youth empowerment’ and one of the guests was Chetan Bhagat.\\nThe fest also brought in performers like ‘The Raghu Dixit Project’, ‘Agnee’, ‘Junkyard Groove’, ‘Beat Gurus’, ‘Galeej Gurus’, ‘Thaikkudam Bridge’ and culminated with a concert by Aditi Singh Sharma.\\n\\nThe fest showcased talent be it in dance, music, sports, fashion show, academics, and more. An LED stage was one of the main attractions of the event. The most-awaited shows were singer Aditi Singh’s power-packed performance and the fashion show.\\n\\nThe LED ramp was decked up to showcase the extravagant fashion show. The fashion show had dazzling attires like sherwanis with their collars up, dhotis with shirts and bright-sequinned dupattas teamed with accessories like nose rings, jumkas, armlets and tattoos.\\n\\nThe models sported bright colour shirts, flowing tops, jeans, sunglasses, shorts with ganjis. The fashion show gave a lot of space for creativity and expressive freedom. The creative choreography stood out and gave all the more reason for the audience to sit up and notice.\\n\\nGaurav, one of the organisers, said, “This was one event that we were looking forward to. A lot of brainstorming and execution was needed and at the end of the day, putting up a great show was all that mattered. I’m extremely happy to be part of the organising team and will miss it as this is my last year in college.

       "  \"Easter marks the season of renewal and revival. Most Christians soak in the spirit of the season with a celebration after observing the Lent. While for many, it is a day to meet family and dig deep into food, for others it is a day about reflecting into one’s own life. Traditions might differ accordingly but the spirit of the day is alive among Bengalureans.\\n\\nAnitha Raj, a Tamilian, says that the day hasn’t changed with respect to festivities. “As a youngster, I didn’t know the true meaning of Easter, but now I do. We celebrate it traditionally, just like in old times though,” says Anitha. “As a family, we will attend the morning mass on Sunday, after which we will head to my brother-in-law’s house. Most of the women in the family come together to cook the feast before the church service itself. This is a big family day and it’s a lot of fun. Sometimes, we all cook and bring something from our own homes too. After the grand feast, everyone sits down to chat,” she says.\\n\\nPeople like Anisha Rachel Oommen say that Easter is a “big family event”. “Our community observes Lent during this season and during the last week especially, which is called the ‘Holy Week’, we observe Lent religiously. Easter day includes inviting friends over and enjoying delicious food,” says Anisha, a Malayalee. She adds that the day comprises of going to church followed by having breakfast with friends and family. “When we were younger, our grandparents used to give us ‘Easter eggs’. Now, my grand uncle, who owns a bakery in town, drops by some Easter eggs, to continue the tradition.”\\n\\nMany bring their own traditions to the City. Expatriates like Dylan Gregory Pristine and his wife Kristine, from New Orleans, USA, are looking forward to the day as it will be something different from what they are used to. “Our kids — Preston and Genie — are used to the ‘Easter egg hunts’ on the day, but this tradition is not practised here. Thankfully, since we have a large expatriate community where we live, there will be a small event for the kids. Also, since we have a small backyard, we will be hiding some Easter eggs, that we bought at the bakeries and the kids will have their own ‘egg hunt’,” details Kristine.\\n\\nDylan adds that in his childhood, the day was about heading to church and celebrating with family. “It’s a day to meet and greet everyone that you are acquainted with at church, but don’t necessarily talk to every Sunday. This year, the whole family will be attending the mass at St Mary's Basilica, Shivajinagar,” he says.\\n\\nFor many youngsters like Derin Sara Mathew, a student, the day is about personal reflection. “This is the first time I observed the Lent period and refrained from non-vegetarian food. The Lent period is about giving up things one feels they cannot do without, and I had stopped using social networking sites also during this time. This detachment also helped me understand the important things in life,” she says. Derin adds that the Lent period has helped her gain more self-control. “As a kid, I grew up waiting for Easter only for the Easter eggs. But now, I have a deeper insight into the day.” She says that she has realised that “this season is more about giving”.\\n\\nBernard Shannu, a Kannadiga, says that the 40 days of Lent also help one ‘filter one’s life’. “We are so busy throughout the year that it is a good time to concentrate on one’s spiritual side and get involved in humanitarian work. This is not just on Easter day but through the 40 days. Easter becomes a reason for all of us to make good and healthy decisions and execute them. It is a day to celebrate with close family and friends, and a good reason to be together and spend time,” he sums up.\",\n",
       "  'Hot-cross buns, chocolate eggs, lamb and chicken delicacies, the celebratory feast for Easter is rich in symbolism. Egg, the eternal symbol of spring, stands tall. With friends to meet, cakes to bake and eggs to be found, Easter offers a platter of good will, and some great food.\\n\\nFor Mathew, a businessman, Easter food is about throwing open the doors to friends. A Syrian Christian, he says, “We are a group of eight to nine friends who get together for Easter. Since we have to attend service in the morning, the breakfast is prepared in advance. Back from church, we have breakfast together, which is usually ‘appam’ and chicken stew.\\n\\nThe lunch preparations start soon. Lunch consists of chicken dishes. For desserts, we have ‘payasams’, puddings and ice-creams. Back in Kerala, the food is tapioca mixed with fish or meat. Basically, the festival signifies the importance of togetherness,” he adds.\\n\\nFar away in Italy though, Easter takes a slightly different flavour. And Antonello Cancedda, Chef de Cuisine, JW Marriott Bengaluru, knows it better. “We take out processions in ancient costumes carrying the statue of Madonna. I come from a village in Sardinia and the procession here lasts for 24 hours. In places like Sicily, where my mother hails from, and in Assisi, you also have people carrying lighted torches. Sardinia was earlier dominated by the Spanish, hence we have a lot of Spanish influences in the celebrations, very dramatic ones,” he says.\\n\\n“Italians love making ‘Colomba di Pasqua’, an Italian Easter bread that is baked in the shape of a dove and topped with almonds. For the main course, we have a lamb preparation which is called the ‘Lamb Fricassee’. It is a mixture of lamb, cooked lettuce (and other greens) finished off with Avgolemono (a sauce made with eggs and lemon juice). This is a speciality of Sardinia,” he recollects.\\n\\nGrowing up in New York, Greg Moran, CEO, Zoomcar, remembers going hunting for chocolate eggs. “Easter celebrations, back home,” he says, “begin by going to church in the morning. Once we get back, the meal is prepared. Pork is the main delicacy. There are pies, ham cheese macaroni and tons of chocolates. We also have Easter brunches. It’s different here, it is hard to find that kind of food here,” he says.\\n\\nEaster is also a time for testing family recipes. When it comes to home-made goodies, “my mom makes great chocolate cheese cake,” Greg adds.  This Easter, though things are different from that of home. “It’s going to be work as usual although I will be going to the church on Sunday,” he adds. \\n\\n Dorothy Victor, a homemaker, explains how Easter is typically associated with hotcross buns. “Since Good Friday is a prelude to Easter, there is the association with cross. However, both the buns and Easter eggs are cumbersome to make at home. Although I have a recipe for this, I have not tried it yet,” she says.\\n\\n“Lunch is always special. During Lent, many of us give up non-veg food, so we usually include a lot of non-vegetarian items like chicken roast, traditional home delicacies, mutton chops dipped in egg batter etc. Then there is also the Indian touch which is the pulav. Whenever an occasion is special, cakes are baked. The children go for the night vigil and when they get back, we cut the cake,” she adds.\\n\\nWhile traditions are reflected in the Easter menu, unusual baking and cooking skills too emerge around this time. The proof of the pudding is, well, in the eating!',\n",
       "  'On the occasion of Easter, Archbishop Bernard Moras has a special message for the readers. “Easter symbolises mankind’s victory over death. It is a man’s hope for an eternal life. It is a gift from God and it is this joy that is celebrated across the world.\\n\\nDeath is not only physical but has many kinds. For instance, we do not take care of our environment and do everything possible to destroy the peace and serenity of our surroundings. By doing this, we are indirectly killing ourselves. We should be more sensitive to our surroundings and go an extra mile to protect our environment. \\n\\nThe world is full of sinfulness and today people are becoming more selfish. We must remember that Jesus laid down his life for the goodness of mankind. He died on the cross and rose on the third day to give hope to mankind. We must live a life of goodness and work for unity and peace among all communities.  This Easter, let us begin life afresh with renewed hope and plenty of positivity. Armed with this attitude, we can conquer the world.”',\n",
       "  'Just the thought of ‘masala puri’ makes one’s mouth water. The snack, which is originally from Uttar Pradesh, is now famous even in countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan. A place in the City where this snack is much sought-after is Karnataka Bhel House.\\n\\nSituated in Chamarajpet, if one takes a walk down the small roads of the bustling bazar street, one can smell the delicious aroma of the spicy and tangy ‘chaats’ of this place. The taste of the ‘masala puri’ here is unmatched. Served piping hot with fresh and crispy ‘puri’, it is a must-have here. While ‘masala puri’ is served steaming hot, the ‘pani puri’ is served with chilled ‘pani’ and hot peas. The other popular dishes here are — ‘sev puri’, ‘bhel puri’ and ‘dahi aloo puri’.\\n\\nStarted by Prabhulinga Dev in 1975, this was the first ‘chaat’ stall in Southern Bengaluru. Having a small board with almost no visibility, it was then known as ‘Chamarajpet Pani Puri Angadi’. Prabhulinga’s sons Virupaksha and Ravishankar now own the place. “The whole concept and name was my father’s idea.\\n\\nThe North Indian ‘chaats’ usually have ‘channa’. But my father wanted to experiment with them by adding boiled peas instead and they were a hit,” says Ravishankar, who has a degree in science. The place was started when he was barely two years old and he says, “My brother (an automobile engineer) and I have grown with this place. This has now become a family business and we did not want to let go of it.”\\n\\nApart from the best ‘chaats’, the place was also noted for its softy ice-cream that was very popular among kids. “We shifted to a new place recently. But we had stopped making softies even before this due to space constraints,” he informs. The only stall dedicated to ‘chaats’ in southern Bengaluru, it has five branches — all well-planned with drinking water and seating facilities.\\n\\nYears have passed but the quality and taste of the ‘chaats’ remain unchanged and it is loved by all gastronomers. Forty years back, a plate of ‘masala puri’ used to cost 40 paisa and the other ‘chaats’ were worth 60 paisa! Now one can grab a plate for Rs 30. “It does not feel like so many years have passed. It is only when I look back that I realise that this place has remained popular for a long time now,” he says.\\n\\nWith five branches, the stall has spread its wings across the City. Each place has the same taste as there is a centralised kitchen where fresh ingredients are mixed to make the gravy. These are then transferred to all the branches. They also have automatic ‘puri’ making machines that make tiny crispy ‘puris’ in no time. Noted for its hygiene, the place has faithful customers.\\n\\n“Some customers have been coming from the day we first opened. They all say, ‘we used to eat three plates of ‘masala puri’ and two plates of ‘bhel’ for Rs 2.50’!” he says. “We want to retain the taste and maintain the same standard,” he wraps up.',\n",

It attracted thousands of visitors reaching a footfall of nearly 15,000 people. The theme of the fest was ‘youth empowerment’ and one of the guests was Chetan Bhagat.

A lot of brainstorming and execution was needed and at the end of the day, putting up a great show was all that mattered. I’m extremely happy to be part of the organising team and will miss it as this is my last year in college. The college and the fest have given me a lot which I will always cherish.”\\n\\nDeepti, a student said, “I was looking forward to watching the fashion show and it was just brilliant. Also, attending a celebrity concert in the City is a far-fetched dream because of the exorbitant rates. When celebrities come to a college fests like this, it is a great opportunity to watch them live.” ',\n",

Even the young have something to teach you,” says Jaggesh.\\n\\nJaggesh is making a conscious effort to break free from the comedy roles that he has been doing and accepting characters that appeal to young movie-goers. “The idea is to entertain the youngsters and I think actors must make all attempts to break the monotony. I don’t intend to stick to what I’ve been doing all these years. I started my career when Dr Rajkumar and Vishnuvardhan were at the peak.\\n\\nThere’s really no character that I haven’t done till date,” says JaggeshJaggesh’s latest release is ‘Vaastu Prakara’ takes a dig at people who believe and swear by ‘vaastu shastra’. “I think people must first be pure at heart rather than be guided by ‘vastu shastra’. If you are a good human being, then good will come to you,” reasons Jaggesh.\\n\\n He adds, “I’ve got the perfect script that I was looking for in ‘Vaastu Prakara.’ ‘Vaastu’ is a sensitive topic and a lot of people repose blind faith in it. One consults it for many things, be it getting married, constructing a house or starting a business venture,” says Jaggesh. He further states that the movie presents this obsession with ‘vaastu’ in a light-hearted manner without hurting anybody’s sentiments. \\n\\nHe confesses that he holds immense regard for director Yogaraj Bhat. “Yogaraj directs only two movies a year but the ones that he makes leave a lasting impression on the viewers. He goes beyond the ordinary. This is the only movie in which I have worked for close to 14 hours a day,” he says. He also feels that Yogaraj Bhat is one of the few directors who thinks differently.\\n\\n“Yogaraj is one of the best technicians and a genuine and creative story-teller. I consider it a privilege to work with him,” he adds. In another project, titled ‘Melkote Manja’, Jaggesh plays a young man who juggles multiple businesses but all fail and he turns into a money lender.',\n",

Hence the harmful effects are nil as compared to cigarettes and chewing tobacco,” wrote Gupta, who owns a thriving beedi business in Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry report titled “Beedi smoking and public health” has a separate chapter on the link between beedi smoking and cancer in which Surendra Shastri, professor of preventive oncology at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, reviewed 15 Indian studies.\\n\\n“Six studies on oral cancer showed that beedi smokers had at least a two-fold higher risk than non-smokers. They had nearly five-fold higher risk for tongue and oropharyngeal cancer. Beedi smoking posed nearly three-fold higher risk for cancer of the hypopharynx and a two-fold greater risk for laryngeal cancer,” he wrote.\\n\\n“In two studies on esophageal cancer, four and two-fold higher risks were found. The risk of stomach cancer was around five times higher. Three studies on lung cancer that beedi smokers have a five to six-fold greater risk. It can be concluded that beedi smoking poses a very high risk of cancer,” he added.\\n\\nBesides mortality and cancer, the report also has separate chapters in which researchers analysed Indian studies to establish the dangerous liaison between beedi smoking and heart diseases and tuberculosis.\\n\\nThe relatively low combustibility and non-porous nature of the tendu leaves requires more frequent and deeper puffs by the smoker to keep beedis lit, and is therefore harder on the smoker’s lungs than cigarettes rolled in paper.\\n\\nBecause of the low-porosity of the leaf wrapper and the absence of significant filtration, beedi smoke deliveries of toxic chemicals are generally higher than those from western-style cigarettes, the report adds.\\nDH News Service',\n",

He vowed to talk to the chief minister regarding Khemka, whom he said had worked towards weeding out corruption during the previous Congress regime.\\n\\nKhemka has now been given a post that is arguably considered insignificant in bureaucratic circles—secretary of the Archaeology and Museums Department.\\n\\nIn a record of sorts, the IAS officer has been transferred once every 128 days. A hurt Khemka tweeted on Friday: “Tried hard to address corruption and bring reforms in transport department despite severe limitations and entrenched interests. Moment is truly painful.”\\n\\nThe BJP, which had used the Khemka transfer issue as one of its talking points in the run up to the Assembly poll last year, has contradicted its professed stand. Interestingly, Khattar, who is leading the state government, is an RSS ideologue and shares close ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Sharma denied that Khemka’s transfer had anything to do with the recent transport strike. “Depending on the need, officers are transferred,” the transport minister said.\\n\\nEntrenched interests\\nDespite assertions of a “routine reshuffle”, Khemka’s transfer is being attributed to him challenging the large-scale corruption and vested interests in Haryana’s Transport Department.\\n\\nAs transport commissioner, the IAS officer had refused to issue fitness certificates to over-sized trucks and trailers to carry automobiles. This had led to a massive uproar among truck drivers in Haryana, who went on strike in January. Eventually, they withdrew their protest after the state government gave them one year’s time to get their vehicles modified as per the Central Motor Vehicle Rules of 1989.

Industry cooperation needed to stop this road menace.”\\n\\nWhether it was the Congress regime or the incumbent BJP government, nothing seems to have changed for Khemka.\\n\\nIn a recent report tabled on the floor of the Haryana Assembly, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had said the previous government, led by Congress’s Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had given undue favours to Vadra and other private developers, bringing huge losses to the state exchequer.\\n\\nKhemka was quick to tweet: “My action in Vadra-DLF land-license deal vindicated in CAG report, but continue to suffer the stigma of charge sheet.

It told the Supreme Court recently that the views of the Law Commission would be sought on the use of Totaliser for counting of votes.\\nThe law panel, in its report on electoral reforms submitted to the government last month has supported the use of the new machine.\\nIt has recommended amendment to the Conduct of Election Rules to give EC powers to use Totaliser for mixing of votes where it apprehends intimidation and victimisation of electors in any constituency.\\n\\nThe rationale behind EC\\'s proposal was that the current system revealed the voting trends in each polling station, thus leaving the voters in that vicinity open to harassment, intimidation and post-election victimisation.\\n\\n\"Prior to the introduction of EVMs, ballot papers could be mixed, wherever it was considered absolutely necessary under the Conduct of Election Rules in light of apprehended intimidation and victimisation of electors.\\nHowever, EVMs do not permit this,\" the law panel noted in its report.\\nThe Law Commission said Totaliser would also help in situations such as witnessed in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Hoshangabad, where an EVM at the Mokalvada polling station in Sohagpur area malfunctioned just minutes before voting was to conclude at 6 pm.\\nA lone voter, who arrived at the polling station at 5:50 pm then had to cast his vote in a newly installed EVM.\\nThe EC issued a clarification that this single vote had to be counted, even if it compromised on the voter\\'s secrecy and instead stated that one way of dealing with such situations in future is the introduction of the new machine to count the votes recorded on several EVMs contemporaneously.\\n\\nIt was in 2008, that the EC had first approached the Law Ministry fo the use of Totaliser. EC said the results of votes polled in a group of 14 EVMs (hence, in 14 polling stations) would be calculated and announced together, in a change from the current practice of counting votes by each polling station.\\n\\nAlthough EC\\'s proposal was referred to a Parliamentary Committee in 2009, no action was taken.

       "  'Even over a century after the British civil servant Robert Sewell wrote his classic ‘The Forgotten Empire’, reconstructing the history of the origin, rise and fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi, the resplendent capital of the glorious empire, abound as it had been with magnificent ruins, had been waiting patiently for over 440 years to narrate its epic of the golden age.\\n\\nThe builders of the Vijayanagar empire not only created a great resurgence in this part of the country but also introduced an era of artistic and cultural renaissance. It is one of the greatest poignant facts of our country’s history that this great empire, which radiated its glory for nearly two centuries, should have met with such a sudden death, never to rise again, as the combined forces of four Deccan sultans invaded, slaughtered thousands of people, plundered and abandoned the city after the battle of Talikota in 1565 AD.\\n\\n“Never perhaps in the history of the world”, says the celebrated chronicler Robert Sewll, has such havoc been wrought, and wrought so suddenly on so splendid a city teeming with a wealthy and industrious population in the full plentitude of prosperity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged and reduced to ruins amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors begging description”.\\n\\nYet, the powers-that-be were deaf enough as to not listen to the echoes of India’s finest hours in the ruins of Hampi. This great capital’s ruins were keen to testify and corroborate the graphic accounts left behind by a number of foreign visitors and ambassadors who were in Hampi during its great days and described it with awe and wonder. Even the name had died out of men’s mind and memories and the remains that marked its sites were known only as ruins. The cultural remains of Hampi had practically drawn no attention they richly deserved both from the point of view of archaeological remains of a great capital and a place of great tourist attraction.\\n\\nHowever, wisdom dawned and wiser counsels prevailed as both the Karnataka government and the Archaeological Survey of India began to evince interest to perceive the imperishable art that lay scattered amidst scrub jungles and heaps of boulders. A national project was launched under the leadership of devoted Archaeological Superintendent Dr S R Rao to undertake scientific exploration of the monuments. These explorations brought to light some new inscriptions, sculptures and mantaps, besides significant evidence taking back the history of the area around Vijayanagar were also found.\\n\\nIt was at this stage the idea for a project for resurrection of Hampi was thought of. Dr George Michell, Architect Art Historian, London, who took his doctorate with his thesis on Chalukyan Architecture in 1970-71 was attracted by Hampi. He brought a batch of scholars from European countries to carry on architectural studies at Hampi and to draw accurate drawings of the monuments.\\n\\nThey came on their own, meeting all their expenses. Among them was a youth Maschek of Germany, who while studying Sanskrit in the Institute of Indology there, worked as a taxi driver to earn money to meet the expenses during his stay in Hampi. Soon another scholar, Dr John Fritz of the University of New Mexico joined the team. Dr Fritz instantly fell in love with Hampi saying that he had never seen such an architectural site anywhere in the world.\\n\\nIn October 1980, Dr Michell in his crusade to present Hampi to the western world, exhibited 70 slides of the monuments and temples he had taken before a packed gathering of Americans at the Asian Society in New York. Dr M S Nagaraja Rao, Director, State Department of Archaeology also participated in the function. It was on the New York soil, the project for resurrection of Hampi took place. Back home, Dr Rao took these foreign scholars to M Veerappa Moily who was the finance minister in the state, who appreciated the idea and made available the necessary funds to execute the project. A high level committee was soon appointed to formulate and implement various plans to resurrect the glory of Hampi.\\n\\nGlobal dimension\\n\\nIn 1986, the UNESCO inscribed Hampi on its world heritage sites giving a global dimension. After that, there have been swift developments all leading to effective protection and management of the Hampi site and its innumerable monuments. Apart from the Centre, the ASI and the Karnataka government, some foreign agencies and universities involved themselves in the resurrection project.

       "  'Awaiting the birth of a child is the most precious moment in every woman’s life. The anxiety coupled with the expectations and the joy a birth brings is an experience by itself. It’s a long journey, those nine months of nurturing another life within you. But the finale is grand.\\n\\nBeing mollycoddled for those nine months is something every lady savours. Then the preparation of choosing the best hospital, the best linen, the softest wool and priciest food takes precedent. Next the long term plans of choosing the best school, college and prayers for a long life for the offspring follow. The world revolves around having the best!\\n\\nAround 2014 years ago, there was a maiden who was handpicked to bring into the world God’s own son. Her feelings on hearing the news must be inexplicable.  But she went ahead with God’s plans with her faithful husband assisting her. There began a strong relationship of trust and faith. They continued on their journey of nine months.\\n\\nThe rumour spread of a new messiah to be born; jealously as is the other face of being human took precedence. King Herod ordered every male child killed. Joseph and Mary had to leave their town and travel with meager means. A donkey and not a chariot carried the Lord’s mother. Every inn was full and finally a stable amidst the humblest of creatures became their nursing home. Stars shone extra bright that night and light filled the otherwise desert land.\\n\\nHer feelings must have been the same every mother has. To love, protect, behold and have the best for her son. Every step he took in his growing years must have been an anxious moment for her. Could she have ever known what would be in store for her “Prince of Peace”? Curing the sick, performing miracles, forgiving and loving unconditionally were his only faults! So, the fury of wanting to put an end to a His life.\\n\\nAt His prime at 33 years He was called upon for the worst ever execution. Where humanity in all its face of evil, concocted a plan that would, disgrace, humiliate and finally put an end to a precious life in the most heinous form. Being human we are the only species that is blessed with a power to think. But when thoughts materialise into such untold actions, one wonders whether being born a human is worth it at all. \\n\\nHe bore it all. The accusations, humiliations, the stripping, whipping, the crowning with thorns, cuts and wounds, carrying a heavy cross up a hill, drinking vinegar when thirsty and finally, the greatest of all sacrifices – not performing a miracle to save himself.\\n\\nHis simplicity was His birth in a manger, His life a sacrifice and the greatest love of all, His death. But what of that glorious mother who selflessly bore just to sacrifice her only beloved son for mankind? Indeed, the greatest love of all.',\n",
       "  'The Union agricultural ministry’s decision to set up a price stabilisation fund is intended to check wild volatility in the prices of farm commodities. This was announced in the July 2014 Union Budget by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. What the government has done now is to operationalise the decision and issue guidelines for the utilisation of the fund. It has been set up with a corpus of Rs 500 crore and will be used to facilitate market interventions for managing prices of perishable agricultural and horticultural commodities. In the beginning, it will be used for onion and potato which are the most common among perishable commodities. Later, more commodities may be covered. Such a mechanism is needed more for perishable commodities because there will be severe losses which cannot be made up for if the right price management steps are not taken in time. In the case of some perishable commodities the time window for action may be just a few days. The lack of preservation facilities like cold storages makes the need for market intervention urgent in most situations.\\n\\nPrices of agricultural commodities are vulnerable to large fluctuations due to factors like unpredictable weather, vagaries of production, problems in transportation and practices like hoarding by middle men. When the prices go down to unremunerative levels, it affects farmers whose livelihood depends on them. When they go up, they hit the budgets of consumers. In both cases, large numbers of people are affected and so there is the need to keep the prices stable at least over the short and medium terms. The proposed mechanism involves both the Centre and the states. The fund will be used to enable state governments and central agencies to launch operations like procurement and distribution of commodities when needed. The procurement will be done directly from the farmers at farm gate prices and the distribution will be made at reasonable prices to consumers through official outlets. This can ensure that there is no distress sale on one side and profiteering on the other.\\n\\nSetting up such a mechanism is not enough to ensure price stability. Operations by the government machinery and official agencies are not known to be efficient. Their responses in crisis situations are not always prompt. So, the usefulness of the price stabilisation fund will largely depend on how well it is utilised. More funds may be needed and more commodities will have to be covered in future. It should also be noted that market interventions are only one part of the strategy to keep prices of agricultural commodities stable.',\n",
       "  \"Aam Aadmi Party MLAs recently led a drive to clean up streets in parts of Delhi where municipal sweepers had gone on strike, demanding pending wages. AAP volunteers putting the broom, their election symbol, to actual use made a pretty picture. But it would be better if the party went beyond mere optics. The AAP government should assume responsibility for sorting out the cause behind the unrest. At least two of the three municipal corporations of Delhi face such a severe funds crunch that they find it difficult to pay salaries to sweepers, driving some of them to strike work. After the sanitation workers deliberately littered streets with garbage, the East MCD released their wages. But now, other categories of workers are talking of agitations for demands like regularisation, which again needs funds.\\n\\nIt’s true that the problem predates the arrival of the AAP in Delhi. The MCDs manage services like sanitation, but don't generate enough revenue for that. They look to the Centre and the state government for grants, which they say have been dwindling over recent years. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to be in no rush to help them out; partly because his state government too doesn’t have much cash to spare and partly because MCDs are run by the Bharatiya Janata Party. This has triggered an ugly blame game. The BJP councillors have held demonstrations, accusing the AAP government of starving the MCDs of funds, and in almost so many words, Kejriwal has told them to ask ‘their’ government at the Centre for the money.\\n\\nThe two sides need to call a truce. And then begin working on a more lasting solution, which involves the Centre as well. The MCDs should get their house in order, by generating more revenue of their own – currently, they manage to collect property tax from just a fraction of the properties in their jurisdictions. As for Kejriwal, he might be tempted to use the current crisis to score points against the Centre. After all, the situation does make a case for ‘full statehood’ that AAP has been demanding. But he needs to be the bigger man here. For his own party’s sake, if not for Delhi’s. That’s because the aam Delhiwallah may not have the patience to wade through the maze of complexities – departments run by state government, MCDs, and Centre – that mark governance in the city. Next time around, the ignorant voter might just take the easy way out and blame everything on Kejriwal, whether it is women's safety or the filth on the streets.\",\n",
       "  'The Gujarat government has persisted with a legislation which it claims is needed to fight terrorism, but has invited widespread opprobrium and opposition within the state and outside. The state assembly has again passed a new version of the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Bill, which was first passed in 2003 when Narendra Modi was chief minister. Successive attempts by the state government to enact different versions of the bill failed over the years when President APJ Abdul Kalam and President Pratibha Patil withheld their assent for them. The bill retained its objectionable and undemocratic provisions through all these versions. None of the arguments put forward in its defence would stand scrutiny in a free society that supports and values the rule of law. It is a law which violates the basic assumptions and procedures of the legal system.  \\nIt gives the police too much power and makes confessions made before senior police officers admissible in a court of law. A number of senior officers in Gujarat have faced charges of involvement in fake encounters and manufacture of evidence to implicate innocent people, especially those from the minority community, in false cases. The new law will make it easy for them to do so. It allows the police to arrest a person and hold him in custody for six months, without the right to seek bail. It will also empower the police to make electronic surveillance easier and to present tapped telephone intercepts as evidence in courts. These are all attacks on the basic freedom and rights of individuals. To cap it all, the police will get immunity from legal action for anything done “in good faith”. The powers are bound to be misused, and innocent people are certain to be harassed and persecuted. The Gujarat police have done it illegally for many years. The new law will give them the legal cover for that.  \\n\\nThe BJP and its governments have always favoured stronger laws to fight terrorism. But it is not the inadequacy of existing laws that cause terrorism. It has also been seen that draconian laws and their misuse by law enforcement agencies create discontent and breed terrorism. The Gujarat bill is designed after the once dreaded Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). There is no situation in the country that warrants the denial of the normal rights of citizens. The Gujarat law will come up before President Pranab Mukherjee for his assent. He should refuse to give his assent as his predecessors have done, in the best interests of democracy and the constitutional rights of citizens.',\n",

Since then the reigning I-League champions have put up a string of good performances to establish their credentials as one of the favourites in the title race.\\nThe teams meet again at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Friday and if the script has to be somewhere close to the one in their previous encounter, the Ashley Westwood-side will have to be on top of their game.\\n\\nImpressive debutants Wahingdoh come into the game on the back of a 1-0 win over Kolkata giants East Bengal and they stay on the heels of Bengaluru with 20 points from 11 games, behind only on an inferior head-to-head record.\\n\\nBFC, fresh from a thumping 4-1 win over Sporting Clube de Goa three nights back, retain the second spot. The JSW-owned team are a point behind Mohun Bagan, who lead the charts with 21 points from nine games.\\n\\nWestwood knows his team would have to sweat hard to gain three points from the tie. “They (Wahingdoh) have shown us their quality this season. It’s good team led by a good coach. And their approach has paid dividends. We are ready to put our best game against them,” said the Briton who expects a close tie on Friday.\\n\\nThe return of Shankar Sampangiraj and Siam Hangal mean the champions will have a full strength squad at their disposal for the tie and it would be interesting to see how Westwood tinkers with his personnel who have given a good account of themselves in the absence of the regulars.\\n\\nWahingdoh has quickly established a reputation as the giant-killers of the league. Though the progress of the team from Shillong might have surprised a few, their head coach Santosh Kashyap believes otherwise. “I have done nothing special with the boys at Wahingdoh. We have been playing fantastic football and the players have responded well to my call.\\n\\n“We started the season really well by winning the opening three ties. Our experience in the Federation Cup also helped us a lot in understanding how a few of our opponents will shape up and the ways in which we could counter them. I have tried my best to keep the boys pressure free as I expect them to play carefree football. And I think that’s something that has helped us in our cause,” said Kashyap.\\n\\nThe game promises to be a treat for the spectators as it would be exciting see the likes of Seityasen Singh, Trinidad and Tobago international Densil Theobald and Jackichand Singh, who is the leading scorer for the visitors with four goals to his name, battle it out against the creativity of BFC’s little magician Eugeneson Lyngdoh, Joshua Walker and Thoi Singh in the midfield.\\n\\nIt would also be a test of nerves for the BFC\\u2008rearguard that has let in 18 goals in the league so far.

His saves can make him a hero overnight, while his mistakes can make him the villain in no time.\\n\\nPerforming such a role with alacrity is Bengaluru boy Nikhil Bernard, who has been turning out for Royal Wahingdoh in recent seasons. The Shillong side is placed third on the table with 20 points from 11 games and it is no surprise that their shot-stopper has be an influential element for the side.\\n\\n“We have been playing well as a unit with players filling in for one another when the need arises. When the season started, we were determined to put up a good show. And with this being our debut season in the league, the hunger has just multiplied manifold,” said Nikhil. Bernard started his career with Southern Blues and was picked up by Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club. In 2012, the Bengalurean headed north as he joined Wahingdoh, a second division team then. “I was with HAL when the Wahingdoh scouts came down for one of our games. They were impressed by my performance and within a few days I got a call from the club’s chief Dominic Sutgna Tariang asking me if I would like to join the club. In no time I was on my way to Shillong,” said the 25-year-old.\\n\\nBernard played an important role in Wahingdoh’s promotion to the I-League top division and he believes that the second division experience has helped his team. “The second division experience has helped us prepare for the I-League. The Federation Cup helped us understand the quality of I-League and the opponents,” he added.\\n\\nThe squad’s rotation policy means Bernard has been restricted to six matches so far. “Though there have been a couple of mistakes, it’s been a learning experience,” he said.\\n“It’s not only me, but my fellow ’keeper Prem Singh has also done well. The rotation policy adopted by the coach has aided us and with both the ’keepers doing well, the place in the starting eleven is a tough fight,” added Bernard, who has two clean sheets to his name.\\n\\nWahingdoh will be up against a formidable Bengaluru FC\\u2008here on Friday and it would be interesting to see if the local boy gets the nod from his coach.',\n",

The Royal Challengers Bangalore’s nets on a bright Thursday evening offered us both the sides of Aaron.\\n\\nBefore stretching the speedometer to the red zone at the training session, Aaron faced the scribes for a few minutes, and he faced a generic query on cricketers’ eagerness to step back on to the field after a winding World Cup. “Every cricketer might find it hard, because you worked your a** off,” he stopped mid-sentence with a sheepish grin. “Oops, make it worked hard to win the World Cup, so you might be a bit zoned out,” he completed the sentence with a laughter.\\n\\nIt’s that easy going nature keeps Aaron going even amidst a multitude of disappointments as a cricketer -- injuries, missing out on a World Cup berth etc. Now, Royal Challengers would require Aaron in that space for a good part of the IPL in the absence of Mitchell\\u2008Starc and Adam Milne. Starc, the man of the tournament in the World Cup and Milne, a fast bowler from New Zealand, were expected to carry RCB’s pace department, but both have been ruled out for some time due to injuries.\\n\\n“It's sad that Mitch (Starc) is injured and Adam Milne too is injured. So, it's up to the domestic bowlers to step up,” Aaron said. Obviously, Aaron will be handed the responsbility of leading the RCB\\u2008attack. Is there any added pressure? “There is no pressure. But it's an added responsibility which is good. So, you get on to the field knowing that a lot rests on your shoulders to do well which I feel is a good motivating factor,” he said.\\n\\nAaron has a simple formula to handle those external pressures -- not to think too far ahead or about the bygones but just concentrate on the work at hand. “If you think too many things at a time it literally messes up everything. So, at the moment there is no pressure but I think it’s an added responsibility. So, it's just the way you look at it. If you think you want to play for India and things like that...at the end of the day you have to go out and bowl your best.” \\n\\nThe work at hand is leading the Royal Challengers’ attack in the IPL. “IPL is something you can express yourself and I am really looking forward to contribute to the RCB's cause as much as possible. Last season we started off really well and it didn't end as we wanted but this year I would like to take it till the end,” he said.\\n\\nAaron also has another point to look forward to in the immediate future. He can work on the finer aspects of fast bowling with two shrewd coaches -- B\\u2008Arun and Allan Donald. Aaron is understandably delighted. “It's great to have them.

His team finished at bottom and the South African conceded he was “caught off guard” by workings of the T20 league.\\n\\nHowever, Kirsten said, unlike last year they have got a good backup strength besides a balanced unit.“I was caught off guard without a doubt. I think any young coach into this space would be. I learnt a lot from last year. IPL is very different from international cricket and takes a bit of getting used to,” Kirsten told reporters on Thursday after the team’s first practice session at the Palam ground.\\n\\n“I think we have put together a nice squad this year.

He obviously wants to keep playing and he has got some aspiration in his game. He is aware he needs to prove his worth but we also want him to be a mentor to the young bowlers. He has got good experience, he has got good ideas for T20 bowling and most importantly he knows all the players in T20 cricket,” said Kirsten who had guided India to 2011 World Cup title.\\n\\nYuvraj Singh, the man of the tournament in that World Cup, has been roped by the Daredevils this year.

But, the State CID continued its investigation and arrested the accused on March 26. This arrest was, however, cited by the Centre to reject the State’s recommendation for a CBI probe into the case. In the Ravi case, the CID has not continued the investigation. A senior CID official said, “Once the CBI probe is ordered, it is the practice to stop the investigation. Normally, the formalities involved in handing over a probe to CBI take two weeks,” the official said.\\n\\nThough CID had prepared an interim report to be submitted to the State government, it could not do so in the wake of the High Court stay, following a petition by Sudhir Reddy, husband of IAS officer Rohini Sindhoori, a batchmate of Ravi.',\n",

       "  'Job candidates who are warm, friendly and assertive are more likely to bag the position, a new study suggests.\\n\\nAmanda Feiler and Deborah Powell of the University of Guelph in Canada observed what anxious people do during an interview, and how others respond to them.\\n\\nThe researchers set out to establish why anxious job candidates receive lower performance ratings during an interview.\\n\\nTheir study is the first to use a validated interview anxiety measure with which to rate how interviewees behave, what signals they send out, and how they are perceived by those who are choosing the right person for the job.\\n\\nThey therefore videotaped and transcribed the mock job interviews of 125 undergraduate students from a Canadian university. Ratings were obtained from 18 interviewers who gauged the interviewees\\' levels of anxiety and performance.\\n\\nTrained raters also assessed how the interviewees expressed their anxiety through specific mannerisms, cues and traits. This could be adjusting clothing, fidgeting or averting their gaze.\\n\\nFeiler and Powell found that the speed at which someone talks is the only cue that both interviewers and interviewees rate as a sign of nervousness or not.\\n\\nThe fewer words per minute people speak, the more nervous they are perceived to be. Also, anxious prospective job candidates are often rated as being less assertive and exuding less interpersonal warmth.\\n\\nThis often leads to a rejection from interviewers.\\n\\n\"Overall, the results indicated that interviewees should focus less on their nervous tics and more on the broader impressions that they convey,\" said Feiler.\\n\\n\"Anxious interviewees may want to focus on how assertive and interpersonally warm they appear to interviewers,\" said Feiler.\\n\\nThe findings are published in Springer\\'s Journal of Business and Psychology.',\n",

       "  'As the much-awaited summer vacations begin, Reethika Azariah Kuruvilla urges you to dust off those books and open your mind to a whole new world of creativity and imagination.\\nYou’ve faced dragons, been marooned on islands with pirates, and walked the Pacific Crest Trail. You’ve solved murders, escaped prison, and been a part of huge heists. You’ve travelled to sugar cane plantations in the West Indies, experienced a slice of Victorian England, and seen the heart-breaking beauty of war-torn Afghanistan. All thanks to those words on the pages.\\n\\nReading opens up an alternate universe, a world where there’s more pain and\\nanguish than you’ve ever experienced, more love and happiness than you’ve ever known, more gore and grizzly detail than you might see in a lifetime, and certainly more history and fantasy than everyday life has on offer.\\n\\n“Outside of a dog, a book is man’s best friend. Inside of a dog, it’s dark,” said\\ncomedian Groucho Marx. Call it escapism, call it being a nerd, call it what you want, but reading is the ultimate form of learning…the knowledge that there’s more to the world than the little cocoon you live in everyday.\\n\\nFitness for your brain\\nA 2009 study by the University of Sussex found that reading for just six minutes\\nreduces stress levels by 68 percent, which – to think of it - is a considerably huge amount in the larger scheme of things. While those couple of minutes or hours spent reading, thinking about something other than your immediate concerns, does decrease your heart rate and ease muscle tension, reading also provides some much-needed wholesome downtime. \\n\\nBaroness Susan Greenfield, acclaimed British neuroscientist and author, says, “Stories have a beginning, a middle and an end – a structure that encourages our brains to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance.”\\n\\nReading helps lengthen our attention span and improves our ability to think clearly. This works just the same for young children, improving their concentration and comprehension.\\n\\nStanford researchers observed the brain patterns of PhD candidates, on MRI scanning, reading Jane Austen in 2012 and found that far from being a passive activity, reading actually exercises the whole brain.\\n\\nGood health aside, reading provides an unmatchable amount of knowledge that quite certainly cannot be found elsewhere. The biosphere suddenly opens up an array of exciting things, previously unheard of, when a book is opened.\\nWhy we read\\nReading has been an age-old, much-enjoyed pastime, dating back to 2600 BC where writing was on clay tablets in cuneiform script (discovered in Sumeria, Mesopotamia, now southern Iraq). The means have improved - audio and e-books on e-readers and tablets – but we can’t say the same about our reading habits.\\nGroucho Marx has said a lot of noteworthy things, but his dog remark ranks second only to “I find the television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.”\\n\\nHow applicable is that really in the 21st century? This is a time when nearly everybody on the street has a smartphone stuck either to their ears or eyes. We are told that people have stopped buying newspapers because they get the news app on the phone anyway, and children spend more time staring at iPads and gaming consoles than marvelling at\\npicture books.\\n\\nGetting the tech-savvy kids of today to read may be an uphill task – why there’s so much more available that could interest him/her – but there are still a few determined parents who have managed to inculcate the habit in their little ones.\\n\\n“We always read before bedtime, and my daughter pleads for ‘one more’ every time. Although I’m actually delighted, I pretend like it’s a big deal to read ‘just one more’,” shares IT manager and mom, Prathima N. “She has come to love reading so much that I actually have to take the book away for her to look up and get on with the day,” adds the pleased parent.\\n\\nFor adults, lack of time and energy seem to be the biggest culprits. Getting past the first page can be an insurmountable task. However, you got to stay strong and persevere through those long sentences, especially since the exercise is proven to keep your mind active and your brain healthy. Don’t wait for another new year to make the resolution: Start reading now.\\n\\nWhile reading is a fantastic activity, there is this one statutory warning: You’ll find out that you didn’t know as much as you thought you did before you began your reading project. Not necessarily a bad thing, because you’ll only want to keep reading more to fill in that gap.\\nAs the summer vacations begin, and the weather turns sultry enough to make you want to stay indoors for the rest of your life, dust off those books and kick your shoes off.\\n Open your mind to a whole new world of imagination and creativity and get to know of crazy, weird characters and lives you would never otherwise identify with.\\n\\nHappy Reading!',\n",
       "  \"Alberto ‘Beto’ Perez, the popular creator of Zumba Fitness, tells Jisha Krishnan why you need to sweat in order to be happy.\\n\\nOn his maiden visit to India earlier this year, Alberto ‘Beto’ Perez attracted over 1200 enthusiastic participants to his master class in Mumbai. Globally, there are about 15 million people taking classes every week across 200,000 locations in 180 countries.\\n\\n“Anyone can take a Zumba class,” insists the 45-year-old celebrity fitness instructor, who started his career in Cali, Colombia. “Let loose, get lost in the music and don't worry about getting the steps right. That's what I would tell anyone, celebrity or not,” he says.\\nExcerpts from an interaction:\\n\\nWhat’s the reason for Zumba's ever-growing popularity?\\nWe all have a basic human need to express ourselves and Zumba provides a\\njudgment-free platform to do so. This need is universal, and as long as that basic\\nhuman need exists, Zumba Fitness will continue to be a safe haven for people who want to have a blast and express themselves through movement.\\n\\nZumba Fitness brings forth an entirely new aspect of social workouts that has an emotional connection. It has become so popular because it’s different, effective,\\ninfectious and easy-to-follow.\\n\\nZumba has helped people turn their lives around through weight loss, battling back from depression, fighting through chemotherapy and breaking out of emotional troubles. That’s not something I ever set out to accomplish, but it’s what I’m most proud of today.\\n\\nBesides the fun, what else does dance bring to a fitness regime?\\nZumba is ‘fitness in disguise’. Many people think that because it’s so much fun, it’s not a real workout; but the fact is you can burn up to 1,000 calories in one class, depending on how hard you challenge yourself!\\n\\nPeople are also intimidated by anything that involves dancing, but once they join a class, they realise that we have designed the choreography so that it’s repetitive and broken down easily…so once you do a few songs, you can easily catch on to the formula.\\n\\nThe most important thing about Zumba choreography is that it’s easy-to-follow and repetitive. There’s no pressure in getting the moves perfect. Anyone can take a class and be successful.\\n\\nWhen taking a Zumba class, make sure to maximise your entire range of motion - fully extend your arms and shake every part of your body. Look to really activate every part - from  your arms and core, to your hips and feet - because doing so will further engage your core and increase your heart rate, which in turn will help you boost your calorie burn.\\n\\nBut why are the participants mostly women?\\nThey aren’t actually! The master class in India had over 35 percent male participation. We see about 80 percent of our participants being women and 20 percent men globally, though more and more men are joining due to the popularity of the class and the benefits it provides.\\n\\nAnd who doesn’t like to dance…as long as you have the enthusiasm to try it\\nmentally, you can do it and move at your own pace. And we offer all sorts of classes for those with disabilities or restraints, and even something that’s perfect for the active older adult, where the moves are toned down and more basic, and reflects music from different genres.\\n\\nAny advise for Indian men, who are either too shy/macho to dance?\\nDon’t be shy – women love it when a man can dance. Plus I am always telling men that Zumba is a great place to meet a woman! Zumba is inclusive and anyone can do it, so there is really no need to be shy.\\n\\nWhat's the most common fitness mistake people make?\\nThey forget about eating healthy and focus only on the workout. To truly see a change you need to live a healthy lifestyle, which includes the food you put in your body.\\n\\nWhat's your fitness regime like?\\nI teach Zumba during the week for my cardio and I try to train for one hour a day with weights.\\n\\nWhen you look back on your life, do you feel like you have achieved your American dream?\\nI feel very fortunate for everything I have. When I came to the US in 1999, I was very driven to teach and dance. The most\\nimportant things to me are dancing,\\neducating and making people feel like they are a part of something that changes lives. Zumba does just that so I do feel I have achieved my dream...but there are so many things I look forward to accomplishing in the future too!\\n\\nWhat do you aspire for now?\\nI want to continue to innovate in music and education for our Zumba instructors across the world. I want to bring them amazing new music, dance styles and\\nreally allow them to travel the world through rhythms in a one-hour Zumba class. I can't wait to bring Indian rhythms to our instructors this year.\\n\\nWho's your favourite celebrity student?\\nI loved working with Shakira. She is an incredible dancer and singer. One of my favourite songs to use in Zumba classes is called Dare (la la la) by Shakira.\\n\\nIf you were to try an Indian dance form, which one would that be?\\nBhangra dance!\",\n",

The Kutch unit now wants GCMMF to help them launch camel milk commercially with brand name Amul,” R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF told Deccan Herald.\\n\\nSome estimates put total camel population in Kutch to be in the range of 10,000-12,000, with female camel an average providing up to four litres of milk every day.\\n\\nThe Kutch District Milk Producers’ Union, that runs Sarhad dairy in this largest district of India, has received a sanction of about Rs 80 lakh for support to camel breeders. Sodhi said Amul would need to invest in setting up a milk collection for camel milk and cold chain for its storage across various places in Kutch. “To begin with, it will be on a small scale and if we are able to do 10,000-15,000 litres of camel milk a day, we would be happy,” he said.\\n\\nAmul feels that it will take at least 3-4 months before they can begin collecting and marketing camel milk in Ahmedabad. “All the stakeholders have approached the Central government with a request to notify camel milk under category of milk. We hope that The Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) will categorise camel milk as milk fit for human consumption,” Sodhi said.\\n\\nThe other reason for such a small beginning could be difficulty in sourcing of camel milk in India. “You can get goat milk in bulk but to collect camel milk in huge quantity will be a challenge,” T Nanda Kumar, chairman, National Dairy Development Board, said. India primarily has camel population in the desert regions of Kutch in Gujarat and Barmer in Rajasthan. This could be a limiting factor for Amul to go big.\\n\\nTalking about the health-related rationale of marketing camel milk, that generally has salty taste to it, Sodhi said that it would find a ready market with fitness and health conscious. “There are people who opt for soya milk too. Similarly, camel milk will appeal to niche audience as it helps improve immunity and has great benefits for diabetics, heart patients, TB patients and children with autism,” Sodhi said.\\n\\nThe project is thus being taken up with twin objectives – one to provide an alternative income to cattle breeders and another to provide milk which is high in nutritional properties, low in fat and easy to digest.',\n",

       "  'The British series Black Mirror opens to the resonating sound of a cell-phone vibration breaking the silence of the night. When viewed through the dark and twisted lens, the series adopts science-fiction and satire-driven saga, relying on realism and the techno-paranoia that sound could only mean bad news. In this case, it involves the prime minister of Britain having sexual intercourse with a pig on live national television to meet the demands of a cyber-terrorist.\\n\\nThat’s right! Welcome to the glorious, thought-provoking and surreal experience that is Black Mirror.Charlie Brooker, the creator and writer of the series, is a man with a finger on the pulse. He digs deep into his crystal-clear understanding of the human condition to create the cinematic force majeure called Black Mirror.\\n\\nThe series owns every decision it makes, including that of being an episodic anthology that not only strengthens the thematic value of the show, but also uses dark, funny, horrifying and bizarre yet believable situations to make each episode a unique experience for its viewers. We see a new cast, a new director and a new setting in each episode. However, the series is centred around the complexity of human nature and thrives on examining our deepest flaws.\\n\\nThe series employs technology in varying degrees to varying effect in every episode, observing the overbearing prevalence and our overt reliance on it to cope with our daily lives. The casting is excellent, its superior acting allowing us to dive into each story as it unfolds without a glitch, thanks in part to some slick editing that maximises the impact of a few careful constructs.\\n\\nThematically, the series is a multi-faceted entity of wonder. Rise in mass insensitivity, conversion of the media into a superficial “rating” mongrel, the fate of anarchy in a conformist society, the constant manipulation of society by external forces, and our propensity to gravitate towards sadistic forms of entertainment are a few recurring themes. The rise of artificial intelligence to counter grief, and to examine the morality of duplicating our own conscience make a fraction of the gripping non-recurring themes.\\n\\nBlack Mirror has been compared to the 1959 cult-classic, The Twilight Zone, but what sets this series apart is its relevance in this technologically driven era. The show is at its most brilliant during the accurate depiction of the dark nature of human behaviour in complex situations. Watching a husband hunt for signs of infidelity using technology that allows him to rewind memories makes us feel shameful of humanity’s untrusting and unfaithful side.

       "  'The video, “It’s my choice” featuring DeepikaPadukone with other women has gone viral in the past week. There have been talk shows and spoofs revolving around the same. There have been scathing remarks and overwhelming praise for the same… Yes, it has been noticed.\\nI am sure that was the ultimate aim of the director of the video and his leading lady. For, I believe, that if social reforms were the ultimate aim for both of them, then sadly the video does not make that much of an impact.\\n\\nBut then the actions of Deepika and her fellow group are not the reasons for this article. My contention is towards the words, “It’s my choice” which makes me worry about the future. The attendant of one of the hostels in Bengaluru, who killed a young girl and seriously injured one other and hurt a few others, must have the same justification for his actions. Even Adolf Hitler, who said, “I want war. To me all means will be right. I am the one who will wage the war!” Yes, he lived by his choice killing almost 70 million people and scarring many more.\\n\\nI am sure that the motive of making the video was not to harm other individuals but as Karl Marx said, “Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.”\\n\\nSo if people says, it’s their choice to have sex within marriage or outside marriage, they are forgetting that there is one more individual involved in the marriage and if their urge to stray comes on later in life, after the birth of their children, it will hurt more people.\\nIn the earlier times, quite a few men had the proclivity of necessarily having more than one wife in the form of a second home, or maintaining a mistress or if the finances and strength permitted, a whole harem.\\n\\nWe were distressed at the sheer magnitude of unfairness and humiliation such an act brought upon on the poor, little wife. In many cases, the wife was the last to know about her husband’s penchant for straying.\\n\\nSociety claimed that man was necessarily a polygamous creature whereas women were considered to be monogamous. Yes, we need to change this mindset of human beings, but if we claim that we will follow the eye-for-an-eye’ principle, then we need to really rethink on Gandhiji’s words, “An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind!” \\n\\nBesides, we seem to be taking out our ire on an entirely different generation. Where then is the justice, because we must not forget that all men are not bad and not all men are unjust. Moreover, we definitely are not animals to do what we need to, where we can and with whomsoever we wish to!\\n\\nSecondly, the video says no one can chain my spirit. The same child-like free spirit made an actor much beyond his prime, mow down quite a few pavement dwellers after imbibing spirits. Yes, of course, it was his choice to do what he wished. If the person’s choice is to drive like a maniac, so be it.\\n\\nIf the society has to suffer because of these choices of the free spirit of a few, so be it… after all, it is our life to live by our terms wherever and whenever we feel like. Who said that we need to actually live by Hillary Clinton’s belief when she said, “We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society.”\\n\\nTwo ‘Indias’\\n\\nFinally, it’s not definitely an empowering video for we are really talking about two distinct Indias – an India where educated, Indian men have learnt to change the patriarchal mind-set and are allowing their daughters to be as well educated as their sons and are also allowing their daughters-in-law to be as career oriented as their sons-in-law; and the other India, which does not know about the term called empowerment and does not believe that girls are their privilege.\\n\\nSuch misleading videos  would make vulnerable young girls follow the words of their favourite celebrity and end up digging their own graves because unfortunately, they do not live in ivory towers like the ladies who were featured in the video and cannot all the time live by their ‘so-called’ choice! But then neither can men live by their choice if we really think about it. They too belong to the same society as us.\\n\\nLet us learn to empower ourselves without emasculating the good men for we are not talking about cutting men to size but actually growing alongside them and breaking the glass ceiling like the truly empowered women.\\n\\n(The writer is an Assistant Professor in Manipal Academy of Banking)',\n",
       "  'The proposed reforms to improve education standards in Rajasthan have given enough ammunition to the opposition and social organisations to blame the BJP government for trying to saffronise and implement the ‘RSS agenda’ in curriculum.\\n\\nThe proposed reforms include replacing the present MacAulay pattern of education with Indian value-based education system, compulsory Surya Namaskar and Yoga sessions in schools and allowing BJP MLAs to donate local area development (LAD) funds to individual RSS-backed institutions.\\n\\nThe growing influence of the RSS lobby in educational institutes, suggestions from the RSS for the proposed new education policy of the union government and speculations over appointment of RSS ideologues to key academic posts are being debated intensely in the desert state.  Social and minority organisations have already declared they will challenge some of the reforms like Surya Namaskar in Rajasthan High Court, saying that it is against their religious practice and ethics.\\n\\nThe Rajasthan government is working on changing curriculum in the primary schools. Several NGOs have also been approached to give suggestions. Two ministers holding the education portfolios have  criticised the present education system and have favoured implementation of the ‘Indianised’ version.\\n\\nRecently, school education minister Vasu Devnani said, “We are working on some changes to provide better lessons for the primary students. Instead of teaching them on MacAulay pattern of education that is ‘A’ for apple, ‘B’ for bat or ‘C’ for cat, we will teach them A for Anant (infinity), ‘C’ for computer.” Indianisation of education is the need of hour to make better citizens with Indian values and we are working on that, he added.\\n\\nHigher education minister Kali Charan Saraff expressed the intentions of his government and landed in the thick of controversy by saying, “Since 65 years of independence, MacAulay pattern of education has just produced black firangs. Job oriented and moral based education is the need of the hour and Indian education pattern is the only solution.”\\n\\nFor the BJP government, the biggest controversy has been the mandatory implementation of Surya Namaskar in 48,000 schools of the state which includes 28,000 government schools and 20,000 private schools. The government has restructured the pattern of morning assemblies in the school.\\n\\nAccording to the government circular, the first five minutes of the assembly will be utilised in singing national anthem, national song, morning prayer and taking the oath to perform the duties for the nation. The next 10 minute slot has been fixed for doing yoga, Surya Namaskar and meditation. The last five minutes have been fixed for reading a Hindi and English newspapers. The circular defines the new model of morning assemblies for secondary and senior secondary students. \\n\\n“The new changes in the morning assembly will create a congenial atmosphere for imparting education and it will help in building concentration and retention power in students. It will also improve the mental and physical health of the students and develop their overall personality,” said minister Devnani.\\n\\nMinority organisations’ decision to challenge these in HC was taken at the national meeting of All India Muslim Law Board held in Jaipur where leaders blamed BJP government for saffronisation of education. “We will challenge all these anti-secular decisions of the Rajasthan government in the High Court. They cannot make Surya Namaskar and Yoga session mandatory in schools. Islam permits its followers to bow only before the one who has given birth to them.\\n\\nAs a result, Surya Namaskar and yoga are against the religious sentiments of Muslims,” said Abdul Raheem Qureshi, the assistant general secretary of the Law Board.\\n\\nAccording to him, the state government has gone a step ahead accepting recommendations of RSS and implementing the ‘anti minority decisions’ in the school. Several schools are planning to introduce teachings of Bhagwad Gita in school curriculum and minority organisations have strongly objected to it, he added.\\n\\nMLA funds\\n\\nThe government has allowed MLAs to spend Rs 10 lakhs from their local area development (LAD) fund on RSS affiliated Vidya Bharti schools. Earlier also the Vidya Bharti schools were allowed to receive grant from MLALAD funds and all schools were treated as one unit. But now every school would be taken as individual unit allowing the MLAs to give Rs 10 lakh to each one of them. The rural development and panchayat raj department has approved a proposal to this effect.\\n\\nThe RSS-affiliated Vidya Bharti runs a network of schools in the state. There are about 600 schools running under the names of Adarsh Vidya Mandir, Vidya Niketan and Saraswati Balika Mandir.\\n\\n“The previous government’s policy was wrong so we asked our government to change it. When schools are operating in different constituencies, how come money could be given at one place,” a senior BJP legislator.\\n\\nThe increasing influence of the RSS is evident from the recent resignation of Prof Dev Swarup, vice chancellor of Rajasthan University and appointment of new chairperson of Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education, who is seen as strong supports of Sangh. Prof Swarup, resigned a couple of months back alleging undue pressure from the RSS lobby and government nominees in the syndicate.\\n\\nStrong rumours of appointment of RSS ideologues to key posts in the education sector and the RSS proposing a new education policy to the Union government are also doing rounds in the state. “Recently, the state government closed many minority linguistic schools and merged them into general schools. Now, the RSS is preparing an education policy targeting minority institutes. It is completely saffronisation of education in Rajasthan,” said a Muslim leader.',\n",
       "  'On the day he took office, President Barack Obama reached out to America’s enemies, offering in his first inaugural address to “extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.” More than six years later, he has arrived at a moment of truth in testing that proposition with one of the nation’s most intransigent adversaries.\\n\\nThe framework nuclear agreement he reached with Iran on Thursday did not provide the definitive answer to whether Obama’s audacious gamble will pay off. The fist Iran has shaken at the so-called Great Satan since 1979 has not completely relaxed. But the fingers are loosening and the agreement, while still incomplete, held out the prospect that it may yet become a handshake.\\n\\nFor a president whose ambitions to remake the world have been repeatedly frustrated, the possibility of a reconciliation after 36 years of hostility between Washington and Tehran now seems tantalisingly within reach, a way to be worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize that even he believed was awarded prematurely. Yet the deal remains unfinished and unsigned, and critics worried that he was giving up too much while grasping for the illusion of peace.\\n\\n“Right now, he has no foreign policy legacy,” said Cliff Kupchan, an Iran specialist who has been tracking the talks as chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. “He’s got a list of foreign policy failures. A deal with Iran and the ensuing transformation of politics in West Asia would provide one of the more robust foreign policy legacies of any recent presidencies. It’s kind of all in for Obama. He has nothing else. So for him it’s all or nothing.”\\n\\nAs Obama stepped into the Rose Garden to announce what he called a historic understanding, he seemed alternately relieved that it came together and combative with those in Congress who would tear it apart. While its provisions must be translated into writing by June 30, he presented it as a breakthrough that will, if made final, make the world a safer place, the kind of legacy any president would like to leave. “This has been a long time coming,” he said.\\n\\nObama cited the same John F Kennedy quote he referenced earlier in the week when visiting a new institute dedicated to the former president’s brother, Senator Edward M Kennedy: “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.”\\n\\nThe sense of celebration was captured by aides standing nearby in the Colonnade who exchanged fist bumps at the end of the president’s remarks.\\n\\nBut Obama will have a hard time convincing a skeptical Congress, where Republicans and many Democrats are deeply concerned that he has grown so desperate to reach a deal that he is trading away US and Israeli security. At the same time he tries to reach finality with Iran, he will have to fend off legislative efforts, joined even by some of his friends, to force a tougher posture.\\n\\nHouse Speaker John A Boehner, who has been travelling in West Asia in recent days, repeated his insistence that Congress review any deal before sanctions are eased. “My concerns about Iran’s efforts to foment unrest, brutal violence and terror have only grown,” Boehner said in a statement. “It would be naïve to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear programme, and any economic relief, to further destabilise the region.”\\n\\nObama tried to reverse that argument on  Thursday, framing the choice as either accepting his deal or risking war, a binary formulation his critics reject. “Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world’s major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?” Obama asked. If Congress kills the deal “then it’s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy.”\\n\\nAn agreement with Iran remains the most promising goal left in a foreign policy agenda that has unravelled since Obama took office. Rather than building a new partnership with Russia, he faces a new Cold War. Rather than ending the war in Iraq, he has sent US forces back to fight the Islamic State, though primarily from the air. Rather than defeating al-Qaeda, he finds himself chasing its offshoots. Rather than forging peace in West Asia, he said recently that is beyond his reach.\\n\\nObama still aspires to reorient US foreign policy more toward Asia, and a pending Pacific trade pact could have a lasting impact if he can seal the deal and push it through Congress. He has nudged the world toward more action on climate change, particularly China. He will count the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba after a half-century of estrangement as a major achievement.\\n\\nHoly grail of foreign policy\\n\\nBut with so many disappointments, Iran has become something of a holy grail of foreign policy to Obama, one that could hold the key to a broader reordering of a region that has bedeviled US presidents for generations. Aides said he has spent more time on Iran than any other foreign policy issue except Afghanistan and terrorism.\\n\\nReuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA analyst who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said a nuclear accord with Iran is all that remains of Obama’s dream of transformation. But Obama, he said, has misjudged Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and its president, Hassan Rouhani.\\n\\n“A reading of the supreme leader or of Hassan Rouhani in their own words ought to tell you that there is a near-zero chance that an accord will diminish the revolutionary, religious hostility that these two men, the revolutionary elite, have for the United States,” he said.\\n\\nIf Obama does turn out to be right, Gerecht added, history will reward him. “If he is wrong, however, and this diplomatic process accelerates the nuclearisation of the region, throws jet fuel on the war between the Sunnis and the Shia and puts America into a much worse strategic position in West Asia,” he said, “then history is likely to be harsh to Obama.”\\n\\nR Nicholas Burns, who was President George W Bush’s lead negotiator on Iran, said Obama embraced and enhanced a strategy his predecessor began. “We’ll have to judge him by the final result but so far this has been a successful effort,” he said. “A good deal could prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. A bad deal could end up empowering Iran, a defeat for him and the country,” he said.“In terms of legacy,” he added, “this is one of the two or three things that will determine it, for good or bad.”',\n",

He said he started classes for the eighth standard students at 5.30 am every day. Goodness gracious! “What about my sleep?” I thought, but couldn’t muster up courage to tell my dad. Thus began my tuition saga at Swamy Tutorials.\\n\\nI was off the next morning. It was still dark and very few street lights dotted the route. The open drain which made a gurgling sound and a few dogs barking and howling intermittently were all that was heard. With my heart beating fast, I scurried, tripping over a couple of lazy bandicoots which came in my way. In a few minutes, I reached Gowlibeedi, as it was known then. The street which belonged to the milkmen and their families was abuzz with activity. Milkmen were filling cans of milk to be delivered to homes while the womenfolk tidied up their front yards coating it with cowdung.\\n\\nThe aroma of boiling jaggery wafted through the air, which emanated from a confectioner’s shop that made yummy peanut chikkies. As days passed, walking to my classes became a pleasure. Even during rainy days, I enjoyed braving the steady drizzle wearing my raincoat and gumboots. The few smiling faces that I saw every morning lifted my spirits.\\n\\nI do not know Swamy master’s qualifications but he was a teacher par excellence. He was a great teacher, one I haven’t found in the past three decades. If it was not for him I wouldn’t have passed my high school with decent scores. For him math was music. Humming some old Hindi hit, he would drift into a problem as a fish would take to water. He would give us time to learn and learn well. He wouldn’t laugh even at our silliest doubts. Though I didn’t take up math in college, whatever little I know in math today is because of him.\\n\\nI do not know if his legacy continues today but I, along with his other students, will continue to regard and salute him for his composure, attitude, commitment and enthusiasm. Thank you, sir!',\n",
       "  ' Daniel Vettori has never been a headline-grabber with his histrionics. Instead, he spoke often through his classic left-arm spin and occasionally through his bat. The affable New Zealander has bid adieu to his playing days after the World Cup final against Australia. But the cricket world will not lose him entirely.\\n\\nVettori will be seen as the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL, and of Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash. On his first day at the Royal Challengers’ nets this season, Vettori spared a few minutes to speak about his outing in the World Cup and the way ahead for RCB among other things. Excerpts:\\n\\nHow tough it is to join the IPL bandwagon after an emotionally draining World Cup?\\n\\nI\\u2008suppose many of the players have gone through it before, particularly the Indian guys. They had won it in 2011 at home and then came back and played the IPL\\u2008successfully. So, we just need to take it game by game. We had a good week of break at home to recuperate, and all of us are excited to come back to action through IPL.\\n\\nTell us a bit about your World Cup experience...\\n\\nI\\u2008think it was satisfying in many ways, especially when you make it to the final. Obviously, you would have liked to go one step ahead but Australia played wonderful cricket in the final. I think the whole team will look back at the tournament with a lot of fondness, especially the way they captured the New Zealand public’s imagination. We had some very good games against Australia and South Africa at Eden Park, then the one against England at Wellington, these are the games that will linger long in our memories.\\n\\nHow much would the WC performance boost NZ as a cricketing nation?\\n\\nI think it was very exciting for all of us to make it to the final. We played a lot of our matches at home, in front of full houses which is not a very common sight. I think NZ cricket has got a very good chance to progress from here. I would like to think that a lot of young kids have fallen in love with cricket during the tournament.\\n\\nWe have seen teams stacking up big scores regularly in the WC? Is there a need to rethink the field placement rules?\\n\\nDefinitely, it plays a part in a spinner’s performance as bowling in T20s can be much easier than bowling in one-dayers. Whether it is needed to be amended or not, yes, there’s a place to look into it as all facets of the game needed to be addressed for better balance. The four fielders rule can at times make the spinners’ job a bit tough.\\n\\n Is it affecting the quality of spin bowling?\\n\\nIt’s a part but not the only one. Sometimes, the size of the boundaries plays a part because a mishit goes for a six in venues with smaller boundaries, undermining the effort you put in as a spinner. If you play at a big ground like MCG then the spinners will come into play.\\n\\nYou had your own moment as a batsman too in the WC, squeezing a boundary off Dale Steyn in the semis. When did you actually started to think of contributing as a batsman as well?\\n\\nI was a reasonable batsman in the school and under-age levels. But at a higher level I never really achieved what I wanted to achieve. There were a couple of embarrasing moments as a batsman, and from that point I\\u2008put in a lot of hard work -- little bit change of technique, and little bit change of mindset.\\n\\nI\\u2008began to think myself as a batsman as well without restricting just as a left-arm spinner. Then in domestic cricket too I started to focus a bit more on batting and that helped when it came to batting at a higher level.\\n\\nAustralians sledged Martin Guptill and Grant Elliot in the final, but you’d remarked that you never went through Aussie sledging....\\n\\nI think it is one of things only you can deal with. I think most of the times sledging is over-hyped. The players out there is not much affected by it as sometimes it looks far worse on TV than it actually is on the field.\\n\\nAre you happy with the RCB\\u2008combination this year?\\n\\nWe are excited. We have covered a lot of areas -- bowlers and all-rounders, then there are some strong batsmen. We are pretty satisfied with the combination.',\n",
       "  'Royal Challengers Bangalore have always found a top place in everybody’s expectations’ list prior to an Indian Premier League season. But after seven seasons, one of the most explosive teams in the league has only two runners-up spots to show.\\n\\nMany times, the Royal Challengers have failed to work as a cohesive unit, particularly in the knock-out matches forcing them to remain as bridesmaids. However, the eighth edition offers a different picture. The team management seems to have realised the need to field a well-balanced unit rather a mere assembly of stars.\\n\\nA closer look at the team for IPL’s latest edition reveals they have retained the core of their batting -- skipper Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB\\u2008de Villiers. The troika is an irresistible force, capable of dismantling any bowling line-up. In the last two editions, the batting revolved around them, while they lacked serious talent in other spots. But this time they have recruited the classy S\\u2008Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik, wicketkeeper and a fine batsman, and the talented Manvinder Bisla. Now, there is more depth in their batting as, at least on paper, RCB will not be a chariot pulled by three horses.\\n\\nEven when the incomparable\\u2008Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan were a part of Royal Challengers, their bowling had revealed a certain vulnerability and many times that department indeed proved to be their Achilles’ heel. Of course, they will miss Mitchell Starc, the man of the tournament in the World Cup with 22 wickets, in the initial part of the league because of a knee injury. But they still have enough firepower to withstand the absence of the left-arm pacer.\\n\\nIn Varun Aaron, Royal Challengers have someone who can rattle the opposition with raw pace, while Kiwi Adam Milne — who is expected to return from an injury — and Aussie Sean Abbot, two of their new signings this season, have proven credentials in T20 format. South African duo of Rile Rossouw and David Weise, and West Indian Darren Sammy, another new recruit, can fit into the all-rounder’s slot with ease. Their spin department does not have big names but Iqbal Abdulla and Yuzvendra Chahal can be handy customers.\\n\\nAfter a while, the Royal Challengers squad has a balanced look about it, and head coach Daniel Vettori exuded confidence. “There always have been high expectations on RCB. Last year, we didn’t really meet those. I have confidence in this group that we can achieve a lot this year,” he said.\\n\\nThe squad\\n\\nIndian players: Virat Kohli (captain), Subramaniam\\u2008Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik, Manvinder Bisla, Jalaj Saxena, Shishir Bhavane, Iqbal Abdulla, Yuzvendra Chahal, Yogesh Takawale, Ashok Dinda, Abu Nechim Ahmed, Varun Aaron, Sandeep Warrier, Harshal Patel, Vijay Zol, Sarfraz Khan, Mandeep Singh.\\n\\nForeign players: AB\\u2008de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Nic Maddinson, Mitchell Starc, Adam Milne, Rile Rossouw, Darren Sammy, David Weise, Sean Abbot.',\n",
       "  ' Bengaluru FC and Royal Wahingdoh played out a 3-3 draw in an exciting I-League game at the Sree Kanteerava stadium here on Friday.\\n\\nThe result meant the league table remained unchanged as both Bengaluru and Wahingdoh retain their second and the third spot respectively with 21 points from 12 games. Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan extended their lead at the top of the table beating Salgaocar 3-1. Bagan have 24 points from 10 games.\\n\\nThe tie between BFC\\u2008and Wahingdoh was expected to be a closely fought one. The match lived up to the expectations as both teams kicked-off the proceedings in an attacking mode. The visitors were the first to have a shy at the goal in the 13th minute. Naoba Singh’s delightful ball form the right found an empty Jackichand Singh in the opposition penalty area. But to their dismay, the Wahingdoh top-scorer failed to connect well with his head as Bengaluru’s Curtis Osano cleared the danger with ease.\\n\\nHowever, the wait for the opening goal didn’t last long as four minutes later Wahingdoh went ahead from the penalty spot. The visitors surged into the Bengaluru half with Jackichand finding his strike partner Bekay Bawar on the edge of the penalty area. The Nigerian unleashed a controlled shot, which brushed off Joshua Walker’s arms inside the penalty area as the referee blew for a spot kick. Kim Song Yong, who stepped up to do the honours, made no mistake as he calmly deposited the ball into the bottom right corner of the net to put his side up.\\n\\nDown by a goal, BFC searched for the equaliser with determination and vigour. The Ashley Westwood-coached side came close twice, first in the 26th minute through Sunil Chhetri and then in the 30th minute when a Sean Rooney attempt was thwarted by Wahingdoh’s custodian Prem Kumar, before eventually finding the back of the net in the 39th minute.\\n\\nThe champions worked out a corner routine to perfection as skipper Chhetri flicked on a Eugenson Lyngdoh kick to Robin Singh who powered it past the keeper to draw parity. The score didn’t stay unaltered for long as the visitors were again in the lead, this time, through a Godwin Franco stunner in the 44th minute. Walker once again was at fault as his miscued clearance fell perfectly for Franco, standing about 30 yards from goal. The second half too had goals to cheer about and the home side had the major share.\\n\\nGoals in the 58th and 70th minutes from Shankar Sampangiraj and Walker, from the penalty spot after Rooney was brought down inside the penalty area, respectively raised hopes of a Bengaluru win. But, to the shock of the BFC faithfuls, a wicked deflection of Lalchhuanmwia in the 74th minute saw a Reagan Singh shot ending up in the back of the net just before the referee blew the final whistle, earning a draw for the visitorys.\\n\\nBagan score\\n\\nSony Norde and Katsumi Yusa struck one each in Mohun Bagan’s win over Salgaocar at the Vidyasagar Krirangan in Barasat, West Bengal.\\n\\nThe second-half saw all the four goals as Denson Devadas gave Mohun Bagan the lead (51st) but within a minute the Goans brought the game on an even keel after Augustin Fernandes smashed in from close range from a free-kick.\\n\\nThe city heavyweights, however, grabbed the lead in the 70th minute when Katsumi Yusa from a Norde corner as the Japanese snatched a loose ball from the rebound off Salgaocar goalkeeper Subrata Paul. Norde then gave Mohun Bagan a commanding lead in the 85th minute when the Haitian recruit cut in from the left leaving two defenders for dead and fired in from just outside the box.\\n\\nBagan thus avenged their Federation Cup defeat when they suffered a 1-4 drubbing.. Bagan’s win was, however, soured when five minutes into added time, Bikramjit Singh was sent off for a second yellow card.\\n\\nShillong drub Mumbai\\n\\nShillong Lajong beat Mumbai FC 6-0 on Friday Mumbai. Cornell Glen (21st, 51st) scored a brace while Penn Orji (24th), Zodingliana (47th), Uilliams Souza (91st) and Milan Singh (93rd) completed the rout.',\n",

       "  '“Make your child a genius!” This hoarding on a Bengaluru bus grabbed my attention. The advertisers promised to make your kid, anybody’s kid, a master of general knowledge, elocution, creative writing, art, dramatics, fashion designing, filmmaking and heaven knows what esoteric else.\\n\\nA universe of knowledge and talent, stuffed into your kid in just six weeks for a fancy price. The savvy promoters knew that busy people like us will refuse to waste our time to think. Can talent and genius be bought like potatoes or chappals? Who cares as long as we can keep up with boastful neighbours? Superficial glitz can readily be bought and cobbled together. No wonder they score over hard-earned substance.\\n\\nWe ourselves are busy scrambling up the slippery ladder of ‘success’. Who has time to nurture their own children these days? The problem is not with training courses and camps, which can indeed be useful. The problem is with our own attitude. By forcing our children into countless extracurricular programmes, we expect them to become multifaceted geniuses overnight. Buying talent, genius, all-round development and sundry mind-blowing intellectual accomplishments for our precious darlings seems to be the latest craze in shortcut privileged parenting.\\n\\nHeavy schoolbags and endless exams are no longer enough to satisfy ambitious educationists and parents. A lady proudly shared how her child, enrolled in an exclusive school, even had library exams! What on earth is that? The sixth standard student did not know or have the energy left after a deluge of edifying activities, to care. She simply ticked random choices and submitted her paper to the teacher. Children fare best in extracurricular activities if they pursue them out of interest, and not external pressures. A rigid and compulsive approach kills any natural curiosity and joy of discovering fascinating and fun activities. A hollow sham of all-round development is the end result.\\n\\nMany Indian children are denied even primary education due to poverty. A global report tracking nutritional status of children worldwide states that half of Indian children below five years are stunted. One-fifth of Indian children are wasted, and a large number of them don’t even get ORS when suffering from diarrhoea. On the other hand, privileged Indian children are denied childhood joys and holistic growth by having an avalanche of curricular and extracurricular activities shoved down their throats. While pouring money to buy such education and accomplishments for our children, we seem hell-bent upon turning them into mindless robots and dysfunctional, disgruntled future adults.\\n\\nMeasure of success\\n\\nEducated urban Indians like us are a hard-nosed, materialistic lot. Our houses, cars, clothes and other possessions certify our ‘success’ in life, which in turn defines our sense of self-worth. We live vicariously through our children, projecting our own unfulfilled ambitions on them even before they have grown out of diapers. Modern Indian parents strive to buy education as a commodity for their children. The more privileged ones vie to also buy every sort of accomplishment for their precious darlings. This begins when children are starting to walk and speak a few words. We push them into play homes, prep schools and tutorials before they can remember their own names.\\n\\nIn the good or bad old days, Indian kids bent under schoolbags heavier than themselves. Youngsters routinely took their own lives, unable to cope with the pressure of eternal exams, and the compulsion to get that vital half mark more than the next kid. That’s now become an accepted part of ordinary Indian life. Meanwhile, people like us strive to rise above the average herd by pushing our children into a bottomless quagmire of structured extracurricular activities. We insist on regimenting every moment of their residual time after academics, and drag them into courses, camps and classes to hammer all-round intellectual development into them.\\n\\nVacations are when tiger dads and lion moms go on the rampage. We enrol children into swimming and horse-riding camps, followed by Bharatnatyam and sign language classes. We won’t allow them to waste a precious second, for there’s also coaching for singing and dance contests on TV.\\n\\nTo meet the skyrocketing demand, creative coaches will soon launch courses for mushroom cultivation, sand grain carving and grave digging. We ensure that the miserable young ones are given no breathing space. God forbid they should have choices or a few moments to reflect and ask uncomfortable questions.\\n\\nTo meet the growing demand from well-heeled, busy parents, a new crop of fancy schools promise fast-track all-round development of the child. I’ve written books for children, among other things. Times were when committed librarians and teachers invited me to interact with their students, taking care to familiarise themselves with my work. Together we encouraged students to read and enjoy books of their choice, and freely explore many ideas outside the academic curriculum while having fun. It was an exciting experience for youngsters to actually meet and talk to someone who had written a book they enjoyed. Such breaks from the routine helped recharge the children’s spirits and excite their curiosity.\\n\\nTimes are changing. During a recent visit to a posh school, the teachers’ demands dampened my excitement. I had to teach the kids to become authors in the space of a half-hour session! I spent many years improving my writing and working on those books, and I still feel there is much more to learn. I began my journey as an avid reader. Even as a pre-school toddler, my parents left me free to choose my favourite picture books. But my experiences were irrelevant here. These children from privileged backgrounds had no time for books, the teachers explained. They only needed to learn to become authors themselves.\\n\\nThey had far too many enlightening and personality building activities to keep them busy, and dazzle the world with their accomplishments. Meanwhile, their guardians and instructors saw no sense in allowing them time to understand, absorb or enjoy any of it. They were so busy manufacturing budding geniuses, neither the students nor most of the teachers even knew who I was!\\n\\nI realised how my presence was part of a marketing gimmick. The parents would be informed of the school’s efforts to expose children to experts in various fields. And this would justify a hike in school fees. Since many among us earn a living by providing various goods and services, we will appreciate this innovative concept of selling Mt Everest to busy parents with no time to bring up their children. Parents are squarely to blame. Genius shops are selling what they desperately want to buy. Something that cannot be bought. But we try to overcompensate for our own lack of involvement by pushing our hapless children into an endless whirlpool of activities.\\n\\nPool of potential\\n\\nResearch by scientists is confirming what wise parents have known all along. Babies and young children have immense potential for learning. Findings by Carolyn Rovee-Collier, a psychologist at Rutgers University, suggest that “even at two-and-a-half months, an infant’s memory is very developed, very specific and incredibly detailed.” Language skills and emotional responses to the world around them also begin developing early. Early and sustained nurturing is vital in shaping intelligent, balanced and emotionally healthy adults of the future. Parental involvement is essential for a child’s ongoing development.\\n\\nParents are the first and most important teachers long before a child begins school. The sincerest teachers in the best schools have to deal with many children. They cannot give each child individual attention like the parent. Yet a growing number of educated young Indian parents are too busy to spare enough quality time and attention for their children.\\nHelping children to develop their intelligence and skills does not mean tossing textbooks of Medieval History and Trigonometry into the cradle to produce precocious geniuses. Nor is enrolling kindergartners into the friendly neighbourhood creative writing school likely to manufacture many bestselling Nobel laureates. We need to adopt the right attitude and not allow ourselves and our children to get trapped in rigid and unimaginative training programmes.\\n\\nAs caring and concerned parents, we need to carve time out of our busy schedules to enjoy watching and participating in activities that interest and stimulate our children. Reading aloud, for example, is a joy shared by both parents and children. And you don’t need to pay hefty fees for it. Far from being a waste of time, reading encourages children to explore and learn. When parents read to their children during the first three years of life, the foundation is laid for a lifelong interest in learning. While vital for building brains, reading to young children while they cuddle up to a loving parent or elder also nurtures children emotionally, and lays the foundations for trusting and close emotional relationships as adults.\\n\\nReading books to children opens their mind to new things and places in the outside world. When children learn that books contain exciting stories and pictures, they want to read more. They do far better in school, as books are not something to be dreaded, but a thing of joy. They can understand their textbooks better, and organically improve their vocabulary and writing. As the child grows older, reading expands their horizons of knowledge. Children who are allowed to spontaneously enjoy and take interest in reading, painting, music and other activities become independent learners and thinkers.\\n\\nThey can attend their school work with minimum help, and entertain themselves when they are alone. Once a child enjoys such an activity of her choice, the habit will serve her well for the rest of her life. A child who can think independently will be more competent to deal with the challenges of adult life.\\n\\nStudies and life haven’t become harder these days. It’s the attitudes that have changed. Kids habitually cram lessons, and go to private tutors for spoon-feeding of fixed notes. Then parents and schools herd children into activities such as film appreciation, chess or piano playing, without taking their choices into account. If we allow children to play, to think and decide for themselves, then they will derive maximum joy and benefits from extra-curricular activities. Extra professional coaching certainly is helpful, but parents and teachers need to motivate the children first.\\n\\nUnstructured play time is also essential for children. As parents and educationists, it’s up to us to allow young people some time to breathe freely, and even play in the mud if they wish to. When children explore something that interests them, they learn more quickly and readily remember what they enjoyed learning. By allowing children choices, we can help nurture important skills such as making decisions, solving problems and forging healthy bonds with others. By encouraging children’s questions and curiosity, we can boost complex thinking.\\n\\nPushing children into strictly regimented activities is a reflection of our own fear of failure. We all need to overcome that fear of falling and getting dirty, of failing, if we are to ultimately succeed. Success cannot come quickly simply from unimaginatively planned, one-size-fits-all tutorials forced upon exhausted children. We cannot buy our way into genuine achievements, or expect our children to become perfect at one shot. Let’s take a tip from American author Toni Morrison, whose impressive awards list include the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature. “As a writer, a failure is just information. It’s something that I’ve done wrong in writing, or is inaccurate or unclear.\\n\\nI recognise failure — which is important; some people don’t — and fix it, because it is data, it is information, knowledge of what does not work... then you have to pay very close attention to it, rather than get depressed or unnerved or feel ashamed. ...What you do is you identify the procedure and what went wrong and then correct it.”\\n\\nEven for such a towering, world-renowned literary figure, success and confidence came with time, introspection and constant effort. Who are we, then, to bamboozle our children into camps and courses with the ambition of turning them into TV stars or authors overnight?\\n\\nAre we turning our children into intellectual bonsais by dumping our unrealistic expectations upon their tender shoulders? Is it so difficult to appreciate our children for themselves? Do we have to push them into endless courses and camps in order to transform them into star performers overnight? It would be better if we try to bring light and joy into children’s lives. If only we could allow them some space to play freely, let them figure things out for themselves, and guide them to activities they find interesting and refreshing.\\n\\nReading, painting, music and other activities become independent learners and thinkers.

       "  'She is one of those charming women who carry their age and experience with unpretentious grace… Well, that is how she comes across to anyone who gets to meet her casually. But make no mistake, this woman happens to be Mala Mukerjee, one of India’s outstanding photographers, and someone whose incredible journey in photography began by ‘shooting pictures to amuse myself’.\\n\\nThis unassuming photographer’s cachet of awards include the Art Prize by the Owen Rowley Art Foundation (1993) and a 2002 BLINK mention as being among the 100 Contemporary Photographers of the world, while she has had solo shows at Cottons Centre, London; St Giles Church, Oxford; Sakshi Gallery, Bengaluru; Y B Chavan Art Gallery, Mumbai; Birla Academy Art Gallery, Kolkata; La galerie de l’Alliance Française de Dhaka — Bangladesh; and Tino’s Island, Greece, to name a few.\\n\\nAn instinctive, self-taught photographer, Mala has a knack of snapping up intriguing moments of history — or geography, for that matter; moments that professional photographers tend to miss. For instance, there is that million dollar photograph of the last ball of the Chepauk Test tie in 1986. Mala ended up being the only photographer to have snapped up that moment, and this photograph also became famous for the varied expressions on the players’ faces.\\n\\n“I am not a cricket fan, and I didn’t go there expecting a landmark photograph. But on the field, I could sense from the vibrations in the air that something big was going to happen, and so I just kept shooting every ball of the last three overs,” she recounts. Well, that was quite a long time ago. Since then, Mala has evolved from an amateur to professional photographer — and from narrative to art photography.\\n\\nEarly days\\n\\nAs a child, Mala had access to a camera (a Leica), thanks to her father’s yen for photography. “But he was too busy, and the camera was in my possession indefinitely,” she says gleefully. She adds, “And luckily for my generation, there was no Barbie doll, television, or computer games to distract us from the real world and from real games, which I count as a blessing, in retrospect. In my case, my childhood pastime was photography. When I got married, looking after the family became my top priority, out of my own choice.”\\n\\nMoving to Chennai in 1978, because her husband got posted there, she started interacting with the city’s veteran historians/journalists like S Muthiah, and her foray into photojournalism began. Later, during her second stint at Chennai (1986-89), Mala was invited to teach photography at KFI-The School, a school run by philosopher Jiddu Krishnamoorthy’s Foundation.\\n\\nMala reminisces, “Being a teacher taught me a lot — I was forced to learn. Once, a fifth grader came up to me asking about ‘reciprocity failure’. I was clueless and I told him I would explain it the next day. I went back, pored over books, and learnt that it referred to how colours differ in shades when photographed in low light.” Meanwhile, around this time, Mala was getting sought out by leading magazines and periodicals, both national and international, from Discover India, Frontline, Insight Guide, Indian Express, and Inner Eye, to the BBC Bulletin. And because she didn’t have the stomach to get industrial assignments, she decided to hold exhibitions of her work to sell them.\\n\\nLearning curve\\n\\nThen came the next twist in her tale. When her husband’s posting took them to London, Mala registered for a programme at the London Metropolitan University to learn to develop her own prints, because the prints made at professional studios she had known had always left her unsatisfied. “My own amateur print-making efforts at home failed miserably,” she admits. Much water has flown under the bridge, and now the world has switched over to digital printing.\\n\\nSo, does she rue the time spent on learning to make manual prints? “Not at all, I learnt plenty by learning to do my own manual colour prints. Now, if I get a tint in my photograph, I know just how to handle it by using opposite colours. In a way, learning colour printing helped me to decode the basics of colour,” she states.\\n\\nIt was around that time that Mala became conscious of the need to develop her own distinct style, something that is highlighted by the nuance of the texture, colour, play of light, the abstracted reality in her photographs. The shift towards art photography became more pronounced in her work, with a distinct manner of perception. Yes, perception plays a huge role in her work, as perhaps in all great artists’ works. As for post-processing of images, this is not her cup of tea. “I don’t’ do much, with the exception of enhancing the contrast when needed, to get the colour that I had seen with my naked eye,” she says.\\n\\nShot to fame\\n\\nCuriously, it is her abstract Jantar Mantar series, taken early in her career, that Mala considers to be the strongest of her works, notwithstanding her huge body of work that includes photography across the world. This includes that famous Chinese expedition in 2006 with 13 other photographers from countries like Germany and Norway. Incidentally, this assignment too happened by accident. Officials of the Chinese consulate in Calcutta had seen the pictures she had shot on a holiday in China, and invited her to be part of the Chinese government-sponsored photo tour to the picturesque Xinjiang province.\\n\\nThe two-week travel was a milestone in her journey as a photographer. It didn’t matter that Mala had rather modest filming equipment. She still shot some breathtaking images. “The tour widened my horizons, letting me connect with photographers from other cultures and countries,” she avers.\\n\\nFollowing this, it then became inevitable that she was invited to be the Indian representative of China International Photography Museum and Gallery Alliance (IPMGA), which meets up once in two years. Mala hosted the last meeting of this group in 2014 at Kolkata, where she has settled down finally.\\n\\nBack in Chennai for an exhibition of her most recent series covering China and Kolkata, she says, “If you are looking for any particular theme underlying them, you may not find any. In my work, I tend to rely on my senses, preferring subjects that my eyes take a fancy on.” Well, her ability to zero in on the nexus of light, form, texture and colour in the most ordinary of objects — be it monumental structures and spectacular nature or mundane objects like clotheslines and nondescript spaces like a fading concrete staircase. Through her photographs, Mala continues to gift us with sensitivity to discover beauty in the world around us.',\n",
       "  'The iconic jazz guitarist and composer Wayne Krantz has, over the years, redefined modern jazz with his unique brand of improvisation and his sense of complex rhythms and harmony.\\n\\nAlthough he may appear personally understated, his musical output has been prodigious. With 10 albums, hundreds of performances around the world, a teaching gig at New York University, countless workshops worldwide, active collaboration with the virtual who’s who of jazz and a book thrown in, makes him a rather busy musician.\\n\\nFollowing his heart\\n\\nBorn and raised in Oregon, US, the young Krantz grew up around a culture that included music. Talking about the early years, he says, “I grew up in a music-loving household, though nobody there was a musician. After enduring piano lessons by force for years as a kid, I discovered the guitar on my own.\\n\\nThe first time I knew I wanted to become a musician was while I was listening to a Sons of Champlin record called, coincidentally, Follow Your Heart. After that I never seriously questioned my direction.” With the early conviction of wanting to be a musician, Krantz went on to hone his skills at the world famous Berklee College of Music in Boston studying jazz guitar. Reminiscing on his inspiration from those days, Krantz says, “From my early days as a student to eventually being a performer and a teacher, I am inspired by musicians and painters whose work evolved fundamentally — The Beatles, Miles Davis, Pablo Picasso, Arturo Carmassi. John Coltrane did it. Jimi Hendrix would have, if he’d lived longer.”\\n\\nAfter playing and recording with a wide variety of jazz artistes, Krantz released his first album Signals in 1991, that established him as an artiste to be reckoned with. The album featured a wide array of musicians such as Dennis Chambers, Don Alias and Anthony Jackson among others. He followed that up with Long to Be Loose in 1993. From there, he has released several albums which include Separate Cages, Greenwich Mean and Howie 61 to name a few. His latest album is Good Piranha Bad Piranha.\\n\\nKrantz has collaborated extensively with jazz musicians from across the board. He has played with legendary jazz musicians from the older generation like Steely Dan, Michael Brecker, Billy Cobham, Chris Potter and David Binney and with new age wonders like Tal Wilkenfeld and Ranjit Bardot. His recent album Howie 61, a reference to Bob Dylan’s Highway 61, includes performances by James Genus, Vinnie Colaiuta, John Patitucci, Keith Carlock, Charley Drayton, Tal Wilkenfeld, Anton Fig, Yasushi Miura, Jeremy Stacey, Paul Stacey, Pino Palladino, Gabriela Anders, Kenny Wollesen, Nate Wood, Owen Biddle and Henry Hey.\\n\\nOn improvisation\\n\\nKrantz has preferred the trio format comprising himself on the guitar with a bassist and a percussionist. After the first album, his next two featured bassist Lincoln Goines and drummer Zach Danziger. More recently, he played with the legendary bass guitarist Anthony Jackson and drummer Cliff Almond as the Wayne Krantz Trio.\\n\\nImprovisation is the hallmark of Krantz so much so that he has even written a book on it called An Improviser’s OS. Speaking about improvisation, he says, “At this point, most of what we do is improvised. But there are composed parts to every song, too; those parts essentially define the song, though it can be defined loosely. The more we play it, the more we mutate it. Sometimes, the only remaining mutation is to play it exactly as written. So we play in the moment. That’s where all our decisions are made.”\\n\\nOn the jazzy journey so far, he recounts, “I now travel extensively both teaching and playing, which is quite exciting. It’s a joyous thing to be playing music and I’ve been lucky to experience that with some of the world’s great musicians. Playing and listening to music is an act of love — there can’t be anything better than that, for anyone.”\\n\\nKrantz recently played in India after almost five years for the Black & White Moments in association with Counter Culture. Talking ahead of the trip, he said, “It’s great to be back after five long years, and am looking forward to seeing some new faces as well as the old ones. I think my fans are keenly aware of my mortality; it’s built right into all the improvising I do. Without the hype and marketing of the mainstream to influence them, their appreciation of what I’m doing is based purely on the music and its spirit. I find that profoundly moving. I’m grateful for it. I’m motivated by it to go on, and I think this tour will be awesome fun.”\\n\\nHis fans are hoping that mortality issues he speaks of may not come up any time soon and that they can enjoy several more years of the unique brand of Wayne Krantz jazz.',\n",
       "  'Flowers in white, lilac, red, orange, peach et al bursting on the canvas; faces of common folks and Bolllywood beauties; nudes, and of course, landscapes and abstracts with flowy, bold and confident lines serenade viewers representing dreams, illusions, emotions, and bright feelings of love. All these in water pigments. That’s the world of India’s famed water-colourist, Samir Mondal.\\n\\nWearing a soft smile, Samir says, “Water colours suit my temperament. Born in a small village in West Bengal, I grew up on the banks of the Ganges and played in its surroundings with water, clay, ash and colours I derived from fruits and vegetables. To enjoy and be successful in what one does, a person needs to be comfortable with his/her ambience and I am happy and at ease with water colours!”\\n\\nWater colour revolution\\n\\nTill very recently, in India, water colour art didn’t get the respect due to this medium. Most dismissed it as a mere hobby or child’s work. Neither buyers nor viewers were attracted to it for there was a misconception that serious work of art could either be in oil or acrylic. Interestingly, the world over, water colour works besides being popular, and much in demand too.\\n\\nIn UK, Russia, France, Thailand, China and Japan, large exhibitions of water colour works are regularly held. In January this year, The Masters of Water Colours exhibition at St Petersburg had hosted 80 artists, of them 40 were from Russia while the rest came from other parts of the world. On display were over 300 works from the masters, and Samir was one of them.\\n\\n“There is a misconception that water colour paintings have a short lifespan. In fact, water colour works have survived more than 35,000 years in the caves of Asia and Europe. Even in India, frescoes at Ajanta and Ellora caves date back to nearly 8th to 10th century CE,” Samir explains.\\n\\nIt’s not as though Samir didn’t try his hand with oil or other paints. Especially after he graduated from the Government College of Arts in Kolkata, way back in the 1970s, he, like many others from arts schools in Bengal, were under the influence of British art. So, for a brief stint he too tried working with oils. “I wasn’t comfortable with the medium. Moreover, oil paints and the canvas were beyond my reach. I couldn’t afford them,’’ says Samir, reminiscing about his days as a struggling artist.   \\n\\nStill under the influence of British masters in the use of shade of colours and the subjects, Samir restricted himself to landscapes. “We were taught to keep away from black and white colours. This was the time when I was exposed to Chinese water colours and was excited about their strong and bold brush strokes. One of my teachers, Ganesh Haloi, an abstract artist of repute, influenced me immensely, especially his copies of the Ajanta murals. This led me to begin studying water colours used in ancient cave paintings.”\\n\\nAnd since then he has continued doing water colour painting despite the hardships he encountered. He accepted a job at the Government Science Museum in Kolkata and was later transferred to Bengaluru and ultimately arrived in Mumbai. A chance meeting with Pritish Nandy, the then editor of Illustrated Weekly, ultimately brought him the much sought after recognition. His illustration of a column on the stories of Mulla Nasruddin in the magazine was highly appreciated by readers.\\n\\nHis water colour portraits of Bollywood stars were used in the now discontinued weekly newspaper, Sunday Observer, which featured weekly interviews of film stars like Madhuri Dixit, Salman Khan, Rekha, Madhubala, Jackie Shroff and several others. He was approached to do commissioned work but steadfastly refused, not wanting to sell his soul for a few pieces of lucre.\\n\\nPassion for painting\\n\\n“I paint because I enjoy it, so why should I compromise on my happiness? Just because oil paintings fetch more, I certainly won’t work with it. I have never accepted commissioned works and people have called me mad for turning down offers,” confesses the man who has held many solo and group exhibitions of his work in India and around the world also.\\n\\nTo reach this position, Samir had to experiment and evolve his own technique. Water colour paintings generally gave this feeling of soft gentleness or tranquility while the excitement was missing. Samir integrates definite structures and bolder colours in his works. As he explains, “Unlike oil paints, in water colour every brush stroke involves some modulation. I exploit the two-dimensional space of my paper with motifs and play with the lack of perspective depths. My next experiment is to get the 3-D effect.”\\n\\nSamir gets bored easily and is not repetitive like other artists who continue their fascination with a motif or an icon for ages. He says, “I am restless and willing to experiment. I don’t want to be outdated, I want to be contemporary. I get bored with doing the same thing. I did a series on different flowers when I turned 60 as I wanted to wish people with flowers.’’\\n\\nIn times when top-end galleries and collectors decide the fate and popularity of artists, Samir is an anathema. He is not in favour of galleries or shops. He keeps himself away from them. If you desire a Samir Mondal painting, you need to approach him directly. He is happy to interact, explain about the painting and discuss the art scene in such detail that along with one of his water colours, you would return enriched with knowledge of the art world.\\n\\nHis dalliance with Bollywood, which happened when actor Aamir Khan approached him to paint Darsheel Safary’s portrait for the penultimate scene in the film Taare Zameen Par (2007), he considers his ‘aha’ moment. “I loved the moment when the painting appeared on the screen and spontaneously some members of the audience watching the movie exclaimed, ‘Aree yeh to Samir Mondal ka work hai!’,” recounts Mondal, happy that his work is recognised by lay people too.',\n",
       "  'His is a contemporary conversation with inflections of African dialects. Kinetic energy has a new name, and it is Lucky Lartey; Patrick Lartey, if you want to be politically correct, but the nickname given to him at birth by his father has served well, thus far, for the choreographer. “I am lucky to be here!” he points out, referring to his residency with FACETS International Choreography, organised by the Attakkalari Centre for Movement Arts, Bengaluru.\\nLartey moved from Ghana to Australia in 2011. “Although I’m an African dancer in Australia, I don’t call myself an African dancer. I am an artiste, a choreographer, really interested in seeing how I can draw on African culture to explore what I am interested in (contemporary vocabulary), in an Australian context.”\\n\\nPeople are always intrigued with the connection between his roots and his work. “I may be exploring sensations or feelings or thoughts (rather than tradition); but because they see me as an African, they want to see that in the work,” says Lartey.\\n\\nWhen he moved to Australia, it took him a long time to get used to the western culture of articulating ideas on paper. “Everything had to be written down; the why? How? The methodology, the trajectory... it is a conceptual way (of working),” he explains. In Africa, it was much simpler. “We learn it, we sing it, we swallow it... we dance a lot! I needed to adjust and adapt to fit in,” he confides.\\n\\nWorking with choreographers from different backgrounds — sometimes as many as seven as he did for his first work Meeting Point — coupled with his interest in exploration, led him to discover his own methodology. “My dance has changed a lot since I got here,” he says. “You grow in experience working with people. Though I have been lucky setting up my company, getting work, being able to fit in and establish myself as a dancer and a choreographer, nothing has been easy; but it has been great!”\\n\\nWhat makes African dance different from Western dance is the relationship between the music and dance; “they really work together”, says Lartey. The drummer is pivotal to the presentation for it is he who controls the dancer through his versatile rhythm. The audience and their physical engagement in the dance is of equal importance. The sharply delineated gender roles, reflective of the roles played in society or community, is yet another facet. The dances mimic everyday life and living, whether ritualistic or realistic. “I’ve studied a bit of dance from all over Africa,” says Lartey; which is an understatement for what, in effect, has been his life’s mission.\\n\\n“The constant creation, constant discovery; the challenge of sending a message across to the audience with your body,” is what excites this choreographer. Lartey tells of how a choreographer once asked him to dance the emotion of frustration. “How do you do that?!” he asks; and answers: “You research, experiment, struggle, get lost and finally you reach that moment of discovery, which is a moment of pure joy!”\\n\\nThe choreographer who conducts African dance classes in Australia, gets his inspiration from “plays, musicians, poetry, paintings, art and philosophy; from everywhere. Everything I have been inspired to explore is about human beings; about language, what we think when we sleep, why a man can say ‘I love you’, but a woman can’t...” \\n\\nSo he has taken his learning, tradition and knowledge and used that to go beyond just dancing with music and engaging with the audience, to now tell a story with it. His is a contemporary conversation with inflections of African dialects.\\n\\nLast year, Lartey was in a production with a kathak dancer, and earlier this year, he was working with an Indian and a Chinese dancer while exploring an original template of work. “I just love the tabla,” he says, having worked with a tabla maestro for yet another project. Lartey marvels that “there is a lot of work that has been done on Indian dance in terms of the philosophy behind it, in a bigger contemporary context”. It is a vacuum in the African dance scene that the choreographer is working towards redressing.',\n",
       "  'Antoni Gaudi, the celebrated Catalan architect, was hardly more than a name to us before our departure to Spain on a recent three-week-long visit. What little we knew of him was what we had managed to gather from the Lonely Planet. Even so the information provided on his principal work in Barcelona, La Sagrada Familia, the church meant for the Holy Family of Jesus, was enough to whet our interest and curiosity in this monumental work.\\n\\nWhat aroused our inquisitiveness even more was the remarkably unusual circumstances in which its construction began, continued, stopped and resumed with the objective of completing it by 2026, as it marks the death centenary of Gaudi and would therefore be an apt tribute to the man who gave the church his all when he was alive, yet could not unfortunately complete it in his own lifetime. It is said that Gaudi spent the last 14 years of his life in the basement of the church without even going home so as to expedite its completion. But this grand project is only half-finished as the great architect’s career was cut short in a tragic accident in 1926, when he was hit by a tram.\\n\\nAmbitious projects\\n\\nEver since we read about Gaudi’s unfinished project that first began in 1882 and saw its picture with its eight-feet-tall, massive towers, all over 100 metres high, with 10 more to come as per Gaudi’s original plan, we realised there was a certain mystique about this undertaking. Our wish to visit it some day came true when on a cold dull, gray morning in July we found ourselves standing at its portals, waiting to be let in, even as strong winds blew and heavy rains pounded mercilessly.\\n\\nwe were ushered in, we were at once overawed by the sheer physical dimensions of the monument — its height, breadth, vastness, to say nothing of its most unusual sculpture, its unconventional stained glass windows depicting modern abstract art and the incredibly huge crowds constantly milling in and milling out! Gaudi’s fascination for palm trees is most eloquently reflected in the way the massive columns rise and spread out on to the ceiling, giving one the feeling of virtually being in a palm grove! A Cross and a figure of Christ make up for the altar right now.\\n\\nThe adjoining exhibition with its pictures, sketches, scale models, notes and descriptions shed invaluable light on Gaudi’s plan of work, his motifs, his techniques, his innovativeness, his originality, and in short, “the roots of his organic architecture” that sets him way apart from other architects. A poignant detail about his personal life we learn is that in his younger days he was a sick child, stricken by continual bouts of rheumatism that delayed his start at school. So his mother would take him out for walks in the countryside and spend several hours in the presence of plants, flowers, trees, birds and bees which deeply inspired him, and later got reflected in his works. This observation of Nature led him to study “cosmic movements”, which generated “spiral movements” on the Earth with its power of gravity, the reason why curves figure prominently in his work.\\n\\nStruck as we were by all that we saw, heard and read, what deeply moved us was the sight of Gaudi’s room in the basement of the church. A chair and a work table strewn with papers, documents, books, maps, models, sketches and plans greeted us even as we entered it. This was where he pored over his plans for the church day and night. If some personal belongings like his jacket lent a touch of intimacy to an otherwise sparse and bare room, there was another little article, a cloth bag hanging underneath a lamp against the backdrop of some rolled up maps on the stand that made the whole scene homely and touching.\\n\\nIt was his lunch-bag, we gathered, in which he usually packed two slices of bread, some honey and a handful of raisins! The utter simplicity of the man struck our chords, making it even more poignant that this old, lonely man without a family himself should still have had the urge to build an abode for the Sacred Family. Not for nothing was he described as “God’s Architect”!\\n\\nUnmatched legacy\\n\\nModest and humble, Gaudi was also known to be religious, which explains why he personally considered the Sagrada to be his most important work. We left the place in a meditative mood, but not before peeping into the adjoining classrooms where architecture students come to study Gaudi and his incredibly new style of architecture. It was heartening to hear that he is taught in universities as well. It is said that though Gaudi was not understood properly in his own lifetime and even became controversial (a fate that many geniuses are condemned to), today he is worshipped as a God by his countrymen! \\n\\nNo account would however be complete without a reference to yet another remarkable creation of Gaudi’s, namely Park Guell in the north of the city. Commissioned by Count Eusebi Guell, an entrepreneur-cum-patron who donated his own private land to create an urban Public Park, Gaudi has indeed worked wonders with his imagination.\\n\\nDeclared a National Monument in 1969 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984, it attracts millions of visitors from all over the world to savour its artistic delights amidst natural surroundings. The star attraction is the esplanade or ‘nature theatre’ as it was known initially, for it was meant for open air shows. An incredibly long, undulated bench built with pieces of pottery and fragments of glazed tiles of myriad colours in asymmetrical shapes and sizes runs like a meandering snake all around this square, holding the visitors absolutely enthralled.\\n\\nFigures of reptiles, animals, birds, flowers, geometrical designs, all made with ceramics, broken pieces of cups and saucers, glasses and plates embellish the walls, pillars and ceilings of halls and flights of steps alongside waterfalls. Gaudi’s own house in the premises (gifted by Guell), where he lived for 20 years, now turned into a museum, adds an extra dimension to the place. \\n\\nThe park, which in a sense recalls the Rock Garden of Chandigarh by our own legendary Nek Chand, is a splendid demonstration of what a genius can do even with discarded material. In a way all Barcelona is a garden where Gaudi’s “naturalistic” architecture has struck deep roots and forever strives to rise high like a palm tree as though “to unite Heaven and Earth”!',\n",
       "  '“I was happy when my daughter had landed a good job, and was glad when she indulged herself with saris, but not anymore,” a neighbour confided, during one of our afternoon gossip sessions with a group of women. Reason was not far to seek. The present generation of women have a tendency to splurge on clothing of all variety, saris, most of all, since they are the costliest of the group considering the most important accoutrements — matching blouse, sari fall, and of course, the net for protecting the zari of the pallu.\\n\\n“In our days, we had only three blouses for all the saris — one white, one black, and another one of red or yellow,” she exclaimed, exasperated. “We never bothered about matching everything. But girls these days refuse to even cross the threshold of their homes if the blouse is a shade different to the saree. And the time and energy they spend on picking out the right blouse piece is a cause for concern.\\n\\nMore so since they don’t while away so much time in choosing the sari. And don’t get me started on the escalating tailoring charges taken for stitching each blouse and the sari fall. Our mothers and grandmothers would have been horrified if they were alive now. They always insisted on spending money on gold instead of clothes. Gold and land should always be preserved, they would advice us.”\\n\\n“That’s sound advice,” I agreed, ruminating over the way the elders quietly accumulated gold by making it a silent condition to buy at least half a tola every month. As such, even the middleclass had gold to spare when the daughters reached a marriageable age. No, they did not spend much on clothes. Usually, one had a maximum of six saris. Three that were set aside for special occasions, two for daily wear, and one for a rainy day. But nowadays? Women easily own somewhere around 60 to 600 saris!\\n\\n“My ajji had only three saris,” she said. As though following her train of thoughts, neighbour’s granny decided to take part in the conversation. “One on the body, another on the galu, (a big thick rod fixed above for hanging clothes) and another in madipettige (special box of cane kept for religious functions). And blouses? Only three — a silk one to go with the sari in the madipettige, and two stitched in thick khaddar-like cotton for daily use,” the elderly woman exclaimed with great pride.\\n\\nShe added saying, “My grandmother would not allow anybody to come near her pettige, claiming it would pollute her ‘madi’. We could touch it only after she passed away. And when the pettige was broken open, quite a good amount of pure gold was found stitched into the linings of the sanctimonious box. More than sufficient to give us, daughters, all lined up for marriage. My parents could find no words to thank that clever soul!” All chorused, “We should all be more like her.”\\n\\n“By the way,” one of the women echoed the thought of others, “would she have parted with the gold while alive? I mean, all that gold, during the marriage of the granddaughters?”\\n\\n“No way,” came the shocking rejoinder. “It was her security, not only for old age, but also for the sacred religious death rites. She knew the ways of the world and human failings well to trust her sons.”\\n\\n“Truly, the old of those days had a solid mental frame and much more common sense and foresight than us of this generation, enamoured of glamour.” Did the younger generation overhearing our conversation agree, albeit silently?',\n",
       "  'In the 80s, the nightie revolution swept through South India. The one-piece nightgown or ‘nightie’ completely turned around the life of women, and changed the landscape everywhere. The advantages of the nightie were many — just one article of clothing to wear and wash everyday. And don’t even get me started on the comfort levels. Wearing saris, or even salwar-kameez, in hot weather can be killer. And they come in all colours, fabrics, styles and price ranges known to man. What was not to love?\\n\\nIn fact, the comfort, etc., etc. led the nightie to becoming the preferred costume of many who began to wear it all day long, giving birth to the ‘nightie culture’ that exists even today. You may not see nighties on main thoroughfares, but they are a common sight in residential areas. It is the fave costume of many housewives and some housemaids. Maids sometimes ask for a ‘nice’ nightie, instead of a sari, as festival gifts.\\n\\nOn-the-rise middle-class women adore it too. They wear them when they take their children to school on their Scootys, to transact business in banks, to attend parent-teacher meetings, to go shopping, and for doctor visits. These women add value to these nighties by clever accessorising. In order for these gowns to look ‘more decent’, some women wear towels around their shoulders. The more ‘sophisticated’ wear dupattas, and on cold days, shawls. Some wear their husbands’ shirts over their nighties. More trendy women wear jackets over them. Some friends told me of some devout women who do their pujas in wet nighties. And some go to temples wearing white nighties — another sign of piety.\\n\\nSo, here is an idea. Why not accept and make the nightie the national costume of India?\\nNighties could be designed to befit every occasion. Nighties exclusively for daywear could be ‘day-ties’ — in bright colours and patterns. Nighties meant for at-home wear could be ‘in-ties’ and those worn to go out shopping or visiting could be termed ‘out-ies’. Eveningwear and party-wear nighties could be called ‘par-ties’, and could be worn with tasteful high-end accessories such as evening bags and purses, costume jewellery, stoles and scarves, even sexy shoes and pumps. Sober work-clothes for women could be launched under the label ‘execu-ties’. Of course, they would come with matching accessories like a lap-top case, large tote bag and lunch box.\\n\\nHate having to wear a messy silk sari to a wedding? No problem! Just slip on your ‘marri-ties’, nighties made of Kancheepuram, Mysore, Benaras, art, pure, tassar, Garwal or printed silk material, and embellished with Swarowski crystals or Baroque beads. Do you live with your in-laws, or are you part of a culture where women have to cover their heads? Don’t worry! Wear ‘hood-ties’ or ‘saas-ties’. Have to go out in the rain? Put on a ‘plas-tie’, with a plastic shell, complete with a hood.\\n\\nIn order to deal with the jealousy of men who feel lost in the positive orgy of women’s comfort clothing, we can also launch ‘man-ties’ — for the man who likes comfort on his own terms. The clothing would have plaids, stripes and such masculine patterns while executive clothing would be made of superior blends of materials with full sleeves for formal and half-sleeves for semi-formal occasions, accessorised to the N-th degree. Traditional wear would of course be ‘vesh-ties’ or ‘dho-ties’. Just think of the comfort level!\\n\\nMark my words, folks! This revolution is coming. And when it does, it will sweep every other kind of fashion right off the shelves, with repercussions heard around the world. Then, will I get some commission from the fashion industry for my ideas, I wonder?',\n",
       "  'Madras, Chennai and the Self — Conversations with the city\\nTulsi Badrinath\\nPan Macmillan\\n2015, pp 228, Rs. 299\\n\\n\\n“Paris is a woman but London is an independent man puffing his pipe in a pub”— Jack Kerouac (novelist, poet and literary iconoclast). And in line with the analogy above, my city of Chennai is certainly a veshti-clad temple priest on a bike, rushing away to a puja function at a home or a kovil (temple), unsullied by the unbathed impurity inherent in bus travel; besides, of course, being quicker and convenient.\\n\\nDancer-writer Tulsi Badrinath introduces us to one such priest (who is also a black belt Karate-expert), right in the first chapter of her new non-fiction narrative, Madras, Chennai and the Self, as she profiles a dozen citizens owing allegiance to a 375-year-old Southern Indian metropolis that has quietly and gracefully shot to the top of the best-seller list, so to say. A few months back, publications like The New York Times and Lonely Planet have endorsed Chennai in their lists of places to visit, even reside.\\n\\nBadrinath starts off by talking about her own connection to a city that has nurtured her since birth (in a nursing home on a road close to the beach and sea that defines the place). Her introductory chapter sets the tone of this book, all the way to the concluding pages; and there  you have it — a poetical overview of Madras in history, from the Sangam literature times of yore, to 17th century visitations by the East India Company, all the way till modern Chennai, the Detroit of India, as also ‘one of the earliest absorbers of technology’ — to quote Kiruba Shankar, one of the city’s earliest bloggers and also an entrepreneur, a podcaster, a people connecter and an organic farmer.\\n\\nBut essentially, the book salutes the city through the voices of a dozen interviewees, besides the 13th voice (the author herself). Starting off with our aforementioned Vaishnavite priest K Sheshadari (the man who broke tradition and learnt a non-sattvic sport, yet continued to follow the rules of his calling), we have a list of citizens, some known, some less so, but all with roots in Madras, evolving along with changing Chennai. And so you have a Dalit success story, P Sivakami, IAS officer-turned-writer-cum-nascent-politician, somebody worth listening to for her reasoned talk on caste and the need for farmers to own land.\\n\\nThere is a producer of snuff, inheritor of his father’s debt-laden business, managing still to steer the old company to safe shores. There is a moderately successful cricketer who was unlucky not to reach the top, yet managed to make a mark in the equally noble field of Carnatic music journalism. There is a respected film actor (Vikram) who fought health odds and emerged triumphant.\\n\\nA veteran from the field of education and politics, Dr Beatrix D’ Souza, is a delight to follow, as is the humane gynecologist Dr Uma Ram. The profiles on Nawab Abdul Ali, the Eighth Prince of Arcot, and Faizur Rahman, a Civil Engineer, are, among other things, a cheering commentary on the truly secular and tolerant nature of this city.\\n\\nThere are voices from the past too, as Badrinath recalls her close interaction with naturalist M Krishnan and his wife Indu — a couple who ‘respected each other’s territory, their different interests and pleasures’. But to me, the raison d’ etre for reading this book would have to be the chapter on Sarathbabu Elumalai, the impoverished boy who grew up knowing hunger, in Madipakkam, Madras, then soldiered on with maturity and faith, till he had acquired his engineering degree from BITS Pilani, and an IIM (Ahmedabad) degree that would fetch him a cushy job — which he did not take up, preferring to provide employment through his newly started food business, a catering service company called Food King — that ultimately brought him back to home base, Madipakkam. If there is one inspiring story that needs to be read, it’s this one.\\n\\nBut, sadly, alongside these positive voices, there are negative accounts of regressive traditions: the gynaecologist quotes a professor who broke down after a second miscarriage: ‘I am not a mother yet. This is a disgrace...’ How would she return to her village?’\\n\\nInterwoven with these profiles are the author’s own strands of experiences and memories, the insider-outsider view of a non-Tamil who still manages to feel like a ‘Madrasi’. Some pertinent observations catch the eye: ‘While the city has adopted the Gregorian calendar, its secret rhythms are attuned to the lunar calendar. The festivals, the tithi, the panchangam detailing these are a necessity in most homes.’\\n\\nThe overall image is of an eternal city, changing yet rooted. Tulsi Badrinath’s work is a worthy addition to the recent pile up of books on Madras-Chennai. But, I do have a quibble — the cover could have been livelier, more enticing.',\n",
       "  'Hope to Die\\nJames Patterson\\nArrow\\n2014, pp 496, Rs. 299\\n\\nIn  1993, James Patterson introduced an edgy new detective in his book Along Came a Spider. The detective’s name was Alex Cross — a black police officer with a psychology degree and uncommon insight into the criminal mind. He was an immediate hit with readers. Since then there have been 21 more novels, culminating in his most recent, Hope To Die.\\n\\nHope To Die is actually a very bad place to start reading Cross’s adventures, for the simple reason that it’s a continuation of a storyline begun in the previous book, Cross My Heart. (Cross my heart and hope to die. Get it? Get it?) In that latter book, Cross and his wife, Bree, unravelled a series of bloody murders and kidnappings in massage parlours.\\n\\nThey were helped along the way by a mysterious stranger named Thierry Mulch. By the last quarter of the book, they had solved the murder-kidnappings. But then it turned out Thierry Mulch wasn’t a benign helper. He kidnapped Cross’s entire family and made him think they were dead (they weren’t, and Cross figured that out, too). Cross decided to go after Mulch. And just like that, the book ended.\\n\\nWhich is where Hope To Die begins, with Cross’s family still missing, and Thierry Mulch gloating over the situation he’s put Cross in. As the book gathers steam, Mulch is blackmailing Cross to commit crimes in return for the safety of his family. In order to drive his point home, he’s killing his hostages one by one.\\n\\nBut Cross isn’t one to take things lying down. Even as he somehow keeps Mulch off-guard, he’s on the criminal’s tail. The clues come up, Cross works them out one by one, slowly getting closer to Mulch and his sidekicks. But can he figure it all out before it’s too late?\\n\\nI’ll say this for Patterson: his books are stuffed full of story. There’s something bad, or strange, or interesting happening in every chapter.\\n\\nWhat’s more, everything is so over the top, you’re drawn into this world, the way you’d be drawn into a Salman Khan movie. Cross survives car crashes that are forgotten two chapters later. He gets guided by mediums. He chases down errant truck drivers by hanging onto their side windows and shooting through the glass with the other hand.\\n\\nMulch, on the other hand, is insanely efficient at covering up his tracks and killing temporary accomplices. He understands all about obscuring crime scenes and disabling security cameras, not to mention creating bombs and setting up life-support systems. He’s above all this morality stuff, and bodies fall like ninepins when he’s around. Most importantly for the plot, he also cold-bloodedly comes up with larger-than-life complications every few chapters.\\n\\nAnyhow, step by step by step, Cross figures out Mulch and his dastardly plan. There are few strokes of luck here — Cross and his team of detectives work out every little bit through effort. The cat-and-mouse game continues over 400-plus pages.\\n\\nThe good news is that the story properly ends in this book, with no threads hanging. By the time you’re done reading, you’re virtually exhausted from all the action, and looking forward to the next Alex Cross adventure.\\n\\nHalf of the allure in these books is the character of Alex Cross himself. In Along Came a Spider, Cross was introduced as a tall, well-built man with loving children and a grandmother (his wife had been killed earlier in an unsolved shooting). He stood up for the underprivileged in the area he lived in, in Washington DC. He spent time at the local soup kitchen. He played a piano he’d installed at his house. And he was almost superhuman in his crime-solving skills.\\n\\nHe’s been refined in the years and books that passed. He’s been married again; his kids have grown up. But the cases have kept coming in, more and more convoluted and deadly than before. The cases are the other half of the allure — you simply can’t imagine this level of hyperactivity in real life. The crimes are grisly, the villains have all suffered terribly in childhood, and there’s never a single murder where a few will do.\\n\\nPatterson’s style is sparse and workmanlike: he never gets in the way of the story. From time to time, instead of “showing”, he’ll just “tell” you that this or that character is feeling this way or that way. You don’t mind. You’re too focused on the unfolding story.\\n\\nIf you’re a fan of Hollywood movies with explosions and special effects, and don’t mind the occasional gore, you should give Patterson and Alex Cross a whirl. Only, don’t start with this book — start either with the first in the series, or with Cross My Heart, where the current storyline began. Just don’t expect Literature with a capital L.',\n",
       "  'It’s a typical Bengaluru Sunday in late 2014. Music man Sandeep Madhavan lies in bed, distracted by the Internet when the electronica band Mode.AKA’s Facebook page gets a message from Dibakar Banerjee Productions.\\n\\n“I’m not clued in to know Bollywood, so I thought it was one of those filmmakers who gets you all pumped up about your music in his films and six months later, nothing materialises,” recounts Sandeep.\\n\\nThe impact of who it was hit Sandeep when he Googled director Dibakar Banerjee. “That was when I called Manas (Ullas), the other band member, all excited and giggly, to tell him that our music would be featured in a Bollywood film called Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,” he recalls.\\n\\nBollywood was a nouveau take on Sandeep’s otherwise deep, dark underlay of emotions, surfacing through the strains of varied instruments, always providing surprise turns to the listener, as in the albums released under the solo project called The Burning Deck. “It’s moody and melancholic minor-key music. It’s me sitting in the bedroom creating electronic soundscapes to be merged with analog instrumentation that takes me back to certain places that mean a lot to me. It’s more influenced by cinematic scores and composers than by bands or artistes. My bass-playing isn’t the driving force in the music, because often it starts off as a sound I’ve sliced into a million pieces, or a synth/keyboard click. Music constantly evolves,” explains Sandeep.\\n\\nStraddling genres\\n\\nFor Sandeep, there are the challenges of composing for a Bollywood flick and doing his own number. “In Bollywood, there’s a brief and visuals you have to compose for. The essential framework keeps you grounded while you try to explore the limits of the structure,” explains Sandeep, adding, “Composing your own tunes takes you to places you didn’t know existed, but that can be debilitating. However, each genre has its merits.”\\n\\nHow does music fill the gap where words, dialogues and visuals fail to communicate? “The music in films serves to complement and accentuate the emotional landscape. So it must not detract or distract from what’s been served up on screen, unless the brief is that. There are hits and misses leading up to what you finally hear,” maintains the adman and creative writer.\\n\\nBeginning in Bengaluru, exploring the musical dens of the world and then entering Bollywood, Sandeep has transitioned as a person and an artiste. “I feel like I’ve gone through a few lifetimes since I’ve embarked on this musical journey. It’s been only three years since I’ve been a full-time musician. I’ve met incredible minds along the way, have jammed with them and have understood their way of working,” beams the bassist, adding, “In 2014, I collaborated with a few left-field luminaries like rapper Himanshu Suri (Heems of Das Racist) and writer Jeet Thayil. It was incredible.”\\n\\nSandeep says that 2015 has been incredible as well. Posters everywhere read: ‘Mode.AKA, the electronic duo Sandeep Madhavan and Manas Ullas in Dibakar Bannerjee’s highly awaited noir thriller, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!’, releasing under the Yash Raj Films banner. He comments, “Working with Dibakar was a breeze. He’s got a wicked brain, and the way he looks at things is in a non-Bollywood sense — there’s no room for cheesiness. He allowed us full creative freedom. We got cinematic and massive with the song Andov.a. The movie’s got the makings of a classic,” asserts Sandeep.\\n\\nThe music certainly seems to have the makings of a record blockbuster with over 1 million YouTube hits three days after the release of the film’s trailer featuring a mash up of their tracks Andov.a and Chick.n.\\n\\nTo get the groove to work like mojo on music buffs, what did the musician do? “If I knew, I’d be really rich. It’s the factor of writing down and recording every idea that comes to my mind, wherever I am. Sometimes it works, sometimes it facepalms, but that’s another addition to my music library,” says the roving musician. Bollywood is showing loads of interest in Mode.AKA. “But we’re weighing in on what we’d like to do and where our music can go. These are early days,” maintains Sandeep, but confirms that “there will be some news later on in the year.”\\n\\nDream projects\\n\\nFor now, there’s plenty of news to digest — Sandeep is in between scoring a soundtrack for a short film about cultural differences made by his filmmaker-friend Jake Wachtel in Phnom Penh (Cambodia). “I’m dropping a single called Tell me a Poem with Heems, about his self-imposed exile in India following the breakup of Das Racist. This will be followed by a bunch of tracks that are more hip-hop and neo-soul than anything else, inspired by old school producers and MCs like J Dilla, Madlib and MF Doom,” he goes on.\\n\\nMode.AKA will release its debut album in a few months, “collaboration- friendly, big beats and massive synths as usual.”  Sandeep says he played a lot of 7-string guitar for this album, “and big, dumb riffs that tried their best to channel Gang of Four’s Andy Gill and Soundgarden’s Kim Thayil.”\\n\\n“The Burning Deck’s next and the last album of a trilogy is the story of a boy on a burning deck. It’s made to sound spookier than the previous album ‘Deluge’ with more sax and violin strains. A few singles are melancholic and feature Jeet Thayil. There is an EP with a swing/jazz project called The Watercolour Orchestra. There are gigs with The Kuru Circus, which is a live art performance where I’ve to unleash weird sounds on a MIDI synthesiser,” lists out Sandeep, relaxed in the freedom that rhythm brings with it.\\n\\nWell, it’s a typical Bengaluru Sunday in early 2015 as Sandeep lies in bed, distracted by the Internet.',\n",
       "  '‘Shady XV’ is a two-disc compilation that features both new and classic tracks from Eminem and other rappers featured on Shady Records, a label owned by Eminem. Besides tracks by Eminem, other acts include that of 50 Cent, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf and D12. Eminem is either an anchor or is featured in a majority of ‘Shady XV’’s new tracks.\\n\\nWhile the first disc of the mega album has new tracks, the second showcases the best of the artistes on the label. In addition to Eminem’s Lose Yourself and 50 Cent’s In Da Club, it includes tracks like 50’s Wanksta and I Get Money, Slaughterhouse’s Hammer Dance and Yelawolf’s Let’s Roll, featuring Kid Rock.\\n\\nEminem executes a rapid fire, chainshaw delivery, occasionally peppered by power-rock chorus. Unlike in the past, where Eminem had rhyme coupled with reason, this album does have rhyme, but no reason. He was a rebel with a cause and a pause in his lyrics. Now it is a non-stop arsenal. At times the lyrics are provocative. For instance, in Shady XV, Eminem talks about punching singer Lana Del Rey like he was Ray Rice. He then goes on to say, “I’ll slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster,” and drops many other names: Mike Tyson, Anthony Hopkins, Magic Johnson, Kim Basinger, Madonna and Rihanna (his co-singer in the past). Perhaps the lyrics of Guts Over Fear explains this.\\n\\nHe raps: And I’m frozen, cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from / Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun / So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song.\\n\\nGuts Over Fear features Sia, with whom  Eminem had previously collaborated for Beautiful Pain, and this reunion gives more of the same: Eminem’s ferocious lines almost jarring against Sia’s powerful vocals.',\n",
       "  'He never aspired to be in films. This successful television actor was, however, tempted by the package of UTV, Abhishek Kapoor and the script that made him take up Kai Po Che!. Sushant Singh Rajput was only auditioned for the role he played among the three male protagonists. “But, if given a choice from the three roles, I would do the same role again,” he admits.\\n\\nWhile actors are actors, he thinks, Sushant does feel that film actors are bigger than their small-screen counterparts. “There are minor technical differences — on television, there are extreme close-ups, work is fast and when you are on a reality show, everything is live and you are playing yourself,” he notes. “You have to convince yourself to prepare and research, and everything works when the script and co-star are right.”\\n\\nDreaming big\\n\\nNoting that the problem with television today was (lack of good) content, which is not only illogical but stretched and repetitious, he adds, “For an actor, though, it is easy and great money and you can get famous quickly. I quit Pavitra Rishta because things were getting too monotonous.”\\n\\nOn the other hand, he would prefer even his film career to be more about substance than just success. “My film Shuddh Desi Romance was real, as is Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (DBB!). These are my kind of films. But I concede that larger-than-life films are liked. Even with songs, I have now become comfortable.”\\n\\nComing up after this is M S Dhoni: The Untold Story, which is a biopic, for which Sushant is shooting. But this is that first time that Sushant is promoting one film while working on another. “I am getting the hang of this now,” he smiles when we meet at Yash Raj Films Studio. “All my earlier films were shot and promoted before I began work on my next. This does become a bit disorienting, though.”\\n\\nSushant was last seen in PK, in which he had a small role. “But the hard work is the same,” he points out. “Whether it is as Sarfaraz in that film, or in the title-role in DBB!, I put in the same mehnat.”\\n\\nIs he nervous now that DBB! is on release, completely riding on his shoulders, as there is not even a regular, known heroine? “I never thought of that angle. Yes, I am a bit nervous, because the audience should accept what we have made, after all the efforts we have put in,” he smilingly admits. “But I am confident, and more excited than nervous. I have been asked if the characters and films I accept are not professional risks, but I think that they are challenges.”\\n\\nHe explains, “A genre alone does not decide if a film is good or bad, or will do well or not. Dibakar came to me two-and-a-half years after conceiving the film and had already put in that much homework. The whole team has put in its best, wanting to translate a good script completely on to camera. And this kind of maximisation happens only when the filmmaker and the actors are all looking for the same thing.”\\n\\nDismissing the intimate sequences he has done in the film as “unexpected for Byomkesh, the character, but not for me as an actor”, Sushant insists that actors must be ready for anything as part of their work. “But Byomkesh, just out of college, was not prepared for the seduction, and I had to show his discomfort.”\\n\\nIn character\\n\\nWas he able to contribute something specific to his character after all the research and work done by his director? “As actor and technician, you always bring in something with you, but I cannot pinpoint anything and say that I did that. I kept having long conversations about the film and about Byomkesh with Dibakar, and he would keep telling me to change or maintain what I offered while shooting.”\\n\\nSushant adds, “Dibakar instructed me not to watch the original Byomkesh videos, because we wanted to come up with our own take on the character of this detective. So I read the script, then read all his 31 or 32 stories, and then went back to the script. Dibakar has mixed two or three stories, shown how a man fresh out of college turns into a detective in 1943’s Calcutta, with World War II and our freedom struggle in full fettle, and what was happening in the port city then, with the Japanese invasion, crime syndicates and so on.”\\n\\nPeriod films recreate the ambience with a mix of sets and visual effects that are added later. How much did all that help Sushant to move into his character? “Let me first say, ‘Hats off to all our technicians,’ because it is their work that made me so confident,” replies the actor with a smile. “Our production designer was so good that I never felt I was on a set, because normally, sets look like sets and this looked like a real city. Even the chroma screens for the visual effects were expertly done, so the results were fantastic and a complete source of validation.”\\n\\nHe is happy when we tell him that his director has been raving about him as the choice for Byomkesh, stating that Sushant is hugely popular, good looking, is everything that makes for a typical Hindi film star, but also inward-looking and fierce, eccentric but not flamboyant. He says that Sushant refuses to act until he has worked three or four days on a scene, discussed it and rehearsed it four or five times and that he is a nice, well-mannered man who can shockingly be rude too.\\n\\nSushant laughs and keeps smiling as we add that Dibakar feels that he is a great, understated actor, who is an enigma and has unknown depths. All these characteristics are what make him perfect as Byomkesh. Sushant merely replies, “I am truly intrigued by Bengal’s most famous fictional detective. Here is a man who has no secure job. He has a different wiring from all of us. I am thrilled that Dibakar chose me.”\\n\\nAlright, one query we always wanted to ask: Is he using the name Sushant Singh Rajput to differentiate his identity from the other Sushant Singh around? “Not at all,” he states. “This has been my name from the school records.”\\nAnd how much has playing the detective rubbed off in real life? “Not now, but I would always investigate the details of pretty girls in my college,” he laughs.',\n",
       "  'Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s last film as director was Eklavya. It released eight years ago in 2007. Not that the filmmaker has been resting on his laurels in the ensuing time. In the interim, between 2007 and directing his next film, Broken Horses, Chopra has produced some of Bollywood’s biggest hits — including 3 Idiots and PK.\\n\\nBroken Horses, releasing on April 10, is Chopra’s first mainstream English language feature film based on a screenplay written by Chopra and Abhijat Joshi (PK, Munnabhai). Set in the shadows of the US-Mexico border gang wars, Broken Horses is a thriller that takes off from his own film Parinda (1989). Broken Horses is about the “bonds of brotherhood, the laws of loyalty, and the futility of violence. Shot in and around Los Angeles, the English language film stars Vincent D’Onofrio, Anton Yelchin, Chris Marquette, Sean Patrick Flanery, etc. Here the director of Parinda and Mission Kashmir talks about making his first Hollywood film, and more.\\n\\nWhat has making an English language film in Hollywood meant for you?\\n\\nIt is, of course, a huge thing for someone who did not speak English till the age of 16. It’s a miracle that we managed to make the film and people got associated with it because of the script. Life is nothing without a challenge. The challenge with Broken Horses was to see if I could even pull it off, get the actors and the crew. In America, they only respect you for your work. Here we respect people because they have money. That difference is clear. It would have been easy for me to keep making sequels and blockbusters in Bollywood. After 3 Idiots, nothing excited me and I enjoyed the challenge of working in Hollywood where no one knows you.\\n\\nDo you manage to keep up to date on cinema from around the world?\\n\\nStaying updated is so much easier now. I have them on my iPad or in my car. I don’t go out much. I come to office to write, and spend time at home thinking, writing and watching cinema. There are times when I see my old films again, but I don’t believe in living in the past.\\n\\nAre you going to direct your next film soon?\\n\\nThe next film I am writing is called The River, which I may make next year. I am also writing a Hindi film called Pachasvi Saalgirah. As producers, we have Wazir with Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar coming out later this year.\\n\\nWhich of your films are dearest to you?\\n\\nParinda will always be important as the breakthrough film, while Broken Horses will always be the first film written, directed and produced by any Indian in Hollywood, so for me it will always be very special. I am 62 (though I don’t look it or feel it) and this has been such a wonderful journey. I hope I never stop chasing excellence. I am very aware of my mortality and how important it is to have a good time while we are alive.',\n",
       "  \"If any of the Royal Family see the new live action version of Cinderella, they may be surprised to see some similarities between the prince’s palace on screen and their own Buckingham Palace.\\n\\nCinderella’s director Kenneth Branagh confesses that when he visited the palace to receive his knighthood in 2012, he studied the decor and passed the ideas on to the film’s Oscar-winning production designer Dante Ferretti. “It was a nice thing to go to the Palace and get to see it. I was able to share some of my research with Dante and we have the wide white corridors that are in Buckingham Palace in our film palace,” he says with a laugh.\\n\\nDisney’s Studio’s rebooting of the classic fairy tale, last filmed 65 years ago, is yet another change of pace for 54-year-old Branagh, who is one of the few actors to have received five Oscar nominations in five separate categories: Actor (Henry V), Supporting Actor (My Week with Marilyn), Director (Henry V), Adapted Screenplay (Hamlet) and Short Film (Swan Song).\\n\\nAlthough he is best known for his Shakespearean work both on stage and in film, he has shown himself to be equally adept at directing thrillers (Dead Again), horror (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), comedy (Peter’s Friends) and superheroes (Thor). \\n\\nBut a fairy tale? Particularly one that is so well-known? “The tale has been in various cultures for the last two and a half thousand years and is flexible and has had many adaptations,” he agrees. “It was important for us to reinvent Cinderella and make her a more pro-active, more 21st century character.\\n\\n“For me it’s not a question of better; it’s a question of different. The animated classic from Disney is a quite magical piece of moviemaking but it was made in 1950, and I felt there would be a vast number of people who would never have seen it or seen it in the context of the life we lead and so there would be room for another one.”\\n\\nThe Kenneth Branagh of today is far more easy-going and relaxed than he was when his near-obsessive drive propelled him to virtually non-stop work on the British stage, on television and in films. In the late 1980s and early 90s he and Emma Thompson — or Ken and Em as they were known — were Britain’s premier theatrical couple and he was writing, directing and acting all at the same time, constantly juggling projects.\\n\\nTogether they were a dynamic couple who starred in the television drama Fortunes Of War; appeared on the American stage in King Lear and A Midsummer Night’s Dream; co-starred in the films Dead Again and Peter’s Friends and appeared in Look Back In Anger both on stage and television.\\n\\nTheir joint projects ended abruptly, and he and Thompson divorced in October 1995. Life for the Belfast-born Branagh is lived at a much less-hectic pace nowadays with a lot more humour than in the past. Looking back, if he could give advice to his younger self, he says he would tell him: “Lighten up, just enjoy life, smile more, laugh more and don’t get so worked up about things.”\\n\\nRaised in a working class home in Belfast, he moved to England with his family when he was 10 and as a teenager began his love affair with the theatre and movies. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at age 23, opening its 1984 season at Stratford as the youngest Henry V in the troupe’s history.\\n\\nAlternating between Hollywood, the UK and movies, the stage and television, as well as his Shakespearean work, his diverse acting roles have included the British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton; the vainglorious Professor Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets; Franklin D Roosevelt in Warm Springs, Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger and Laurence Olivier in My Week With Marilyn.\\n\\nFor his Cinderella, Branagh cast 25-year-old Lily James, best known as the trouble-making Lady Rose MacClare in Downton Abbey, who, he says, has both the kindness and courage of the title character. “Her voice is warm and musical and she has a strong sense of humour which is important, plus she’s a beautiful girl. I think that she has a lovely heart and that comes through in her work.”\\n\\nHe cast Ben Chaplin and Haley Atwell as her mother and father, Cate Blanchett as her stepmother, Richard Madden as the Prince and Derek Jacobi, an old friend and colleague, as the King.\\n\\nFor his next project, Kenneth Branagh wants to combine his love for Shakespeare with his newly-found affection for fairy tales. “Until now I hadn’t thought about making a fairy tale as a movie, but now I realise I am being drawn to them. So a Shakespeare play that I have been interested in working on for a long time is The Winter’s Tale which I see very much as a fairy tale. Later on this year we will do The Winter’s Tale on stage in London and in terms of films, it’s always in my thoughts.”\",\n",
       "  'Imagine you were a travelling mendicant in Himachal Pradesh, trekking through the cold terrain, meditating and bathing in the freezing waters of rivers Beas and Sutlej day after day. A surprising warmth and joy would await you if you stopped by a village on the left bank of the Beas some 6 km away from Manali. You have reached the Vashisht hot springs. Hot water, a gift from the heart of the mountains, would warm your body and soul, and rejuvenated, you could resume your spiritual journey.\\nWe found ourselves, ordinary mortals of the tourist species, marvelling this natural sulphur spring.The Vashisht village is located well above River Beas towards the Rohtang Pass. Vashisht hot water springs have made this village famous around the world as proven by the presence of foreigners here. The water kunds (tanks) are in the centre of the village. The temperature of the water varies from 43°C to 50°C and is said to have medicinal properties. Almost 3,000 people take a dip in the tanks each day here.\\n\\nThe Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation has built ‘Turkish-type baths’ at 500 metres below the village. Within the temple complex is a pyramidal stone temple dedicated to Rishi Vashisht. There is also a temple dedicated to Lord Ram. They are small and have beautiful wooden carvings on the pillars. The arrangement for bathing is good, with separate bathing tanks for men and women; one experiences bathing in the open but with sufficient privacy.\\n\\nBeas is referred to as ‘Vipasha’ here. A legend has it that Rishi Vashisht, upon hearing that his children had been killed by sage Vishwamitra, attempted suicide by jumping into the river. But the river carried him to this village. Beas, from then on, was called vipasha, meaning ‘freedom from burden’. It is also believed that when Lord Ram returned from vanquishing Ravana, he wanted Sage Vashisht to perform a yagna at his coronation.\\n\\nLakshmana, who was sent to bring him, found the sage lost in penance in this very region. Concerned that the great sage was living in a place so cold, he fired his agniban (weapon) into the ground, which resulted in the emergence of thermal springs. The great sage gently chided Lakshmana  saying that he wasn’t in need of such comforts, and accompanied him.\\n\\nIdyllic spot\\n\\nWe wanted to visit the holy Manikaran Sahib and eagerly set off to see the famous shrine, a tourist destination because of its hot water springs. Manikaran, at an altitude of 1,760 m, is located in the Parvati Valley between the rivers Beas and Parvati, northeast of Bhuntar, in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh.\\n\\nIt is considered holy by both Hindus and Sikhs. We followed a winding road towards the beautiful valley with the Parvati river flowing serenely below us. Often the therapeutic silence was shattered by motorbikes speeding without silencers. Most of the bikes had no rear-view mirrors. Instead, two yellow flags fluttered on both handlebars. Most of them had Sikh boys rushing to Manikaran to pay respects at the Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib.\\n\\nOur driver, who frequently guides and takes around tourists along these parts, pointed at a few bikers and said they were headed to Kasol for drugs. We absorbed this with much scepticism.\\n\\nSure enough, Kasol had a good number of foreigners of various nationalities. They were relaxing on rooftops in groups. A lot of Jews in their traditional dress surprised me, as also a few banners in Hebrew. It was as if a tiny Israeli village was nestling in Himachal Pradesh. Since it’s a base camp for many Himalayan treks, we could see many backpackers around. It made me uncomfortable to associate anything evil with the pristine valley.\\n\\nAs we neared Manikaran, the bikes grew noisier as they rode the ramp of the tiered parking lot. We walked down to a bridge across River Parvati. Across the bridge where the gurudwara and temples stood, I saw the rising steam from the hot springs near the walls. The breeze had a sulphurous smell (though it is said that the water has radioactive properties and no sulphur or iron content). A dip in these springs is said to cure many ailments — from skin disorders to rheumatism. The temperature of the hot spring at Manikaran is said to be 96°C according to the Geological Survey of India. There are separate public baths for men and women. The very hot water is cooled and fed to the bath.\\n\\nWe then visited the Shiva temple where people bought cloth pouches holding rice and let it cook in two hot-water tanks. The cooked rice is eaten as prasad. The stone floor was hot and the wooden planks helped us walk around the temple. Temples dedicated to Naina Bhagawati, Lord Ram and Lord Vishnu (Raghunath) also attract devotees.\\n\\nWe learned the story of how Manikaran ( jewel of the ear) got its name. The story goes that Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati were walking along this trail. The goddess lost her earring in the river. Sheshnag, the serpent god, is believed to have taken it. Searches commanded by Shiva did not yield the precious mani (jewel). Angrily he opened his third eye and the disturbances alarmed the gods who then requested Sheshnag for help. The serpent lord promised to return it only after he witnessed Shiva’s  thandav (cosmic dance). Sheshnag’s hissing resulted in the hot springs along with the earring and other jewels being thrown forth.\\n\\nLegend also has it that jewels kept coming up till the earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale rocked the region in 1905. It is said the Shiva temple was tilted due to this earthquake. Outside the temple is a statue of Shiva in a furious pose, holding a trident. It appears ethereal seen in the haze of the steam arising from the tank at his feet. Another story proposes that Shiva and Parvati spent 1,100 years here.\\n\\nCommunity kitchen\\n\\nThe langar (community kitchen) food — pulses, rice and even chapatis — for the gurudwara is made using the hot water. Another legend propounds that Sikh founder Guru Nanak came to this place with his disciple Bhai Mardana. The latter was hungry, so Nanak sent him to collect food for the langar. People donated flour and pulses, but there was no means to start a fire for cooking. Guru Nanak then asked Mardana to lift a stone, and when he did so, a hot spring sprouted.\\n\\nMyths, legends and the religious fervour coupled with the scenic beauty of Vashisht makes for a heady combination.The Tibetan prayer flags stringed together were tied to the spire of the temple on the opposite bank. Fluttering cheerfully against the blue skies and the green trees, they bid us a cheerful goodbye.I continue to remain amazed by the way nature springs surprises: an oasis in the desert, precious coral in dangerous oceans, stalagmites in deep dark caves, and hot surprises on a cold mountain.\\n\\nFact file\\n\\n\\nGetting There:\\n\\nDomestic flights connect Delhi and Chandigarh to  Bhuntar, the closest airport to Manali that is 50 km away. Opt for taxis to reach Manali from the airport.Manali is well-connected to tourist destinations by means of state-run and private buses.\\n\\nThings To Do\\n\\nTake a rejuvenating bath in Vashisht ‘kund’, which is 6km from Manali.The best season to visit these springs is between March and October. Enjoy the Manikaran hot springs. Buses run regularly between Manikaran and Bhuntar ( 2½ hours). Taxis are available from Manali and Kullu too. Best time to visit Manikaran is from March to May.',\n",
       "  'I decided to visit Egypt along with a friend for a couple of weeks because the political turmoil there had somewhat calmed down, and the perception of the situation had lowered the prices of air ticket. We landed in Cairo and took a bus to Heliopolis, the area of our stay.\\n\\nOn the bus, we asked a lady about our stop, but since she was getting down, she took us to the driver, told him our destination, and requested him to drop us at a place closest to our address. While leaving, she asked if there was anything more she could do for us. This was our first taste of Egyptian friendliness and we knew we were going to love it here.\\n\\nSay Al Qahira, the exotic Arabic name for Cairo, and I picture busy bazaars, spicy souks, a thousand minarets and of course, pyramids. This bustling metropolis of over 15 million is the Arab world’s largest city. With its terrible traffic, crowded markets and busy streets, I was reminded of India more than once. In fact, I warmed up to the city quickly and felt much at home.\\n\\nWe planned to visit the pyramids and ancient Egyptian temples, but one of the highlights of our itinerary was to visit an oasis and spend a night in the great Saharan desert. We took a bus from Cairo and arrived in the Bahariya oasis at around noon and were welcomed by our host and guide Hamada Kaddora, who waited with a broad smile and glasses of freshly squeezed lemon juice from his organic garden. We were joined by his cousin and our driver, also named Hamada, with whom we enjoyed a huge platter of delicious home-cooked food.\\n\\nThey served us flat bread with meat and vegetables, a baked pasta dish, pickled vegetables, sweets and crunchy, succulent fresh dates. With our stomachs full and our jeep loaded, we set off for White Desert National Park. As we drove through the desert, the landscape gradually became hilly. We approached one of these hills to realise that it was covered in black metallic shards not unlike ashes from burnt paper. These iron-like pieces were scattered on the golden sand. The entire region is made up of such hillocks as far as the eye can see, thereby earning this place the name ‘Black Desert’. We climbed up the sandy mound to contemplate this fascinating scenery.\\n\\nUnder the stars\\n\\nWe drove further and soon the sun dipped below the sandy horizon while white-and-brown mounds began to appear in the distance. At twilight, when the sky was a dark blue with a hint of orange, we arrived at a clearing in the middle of mysterious silhouettes that were hard to discern in the darkness. Hamada’s uncles and cousins from Cairo joined us. This was the site of our camp, and while they set it up, they refused our help and instead asked us to lie on the sand and watch the enormous sky that was lit up with billions of shimmering stars — a rare sight for city folks like us.\\n\\nIt was relaxing to let my toes sink in the cool grains of the sand. Several shooting stars later, the kitchen got busy and this time we joined our hosts in the cooking. The smell attracted a large-eared fennec fox and in a matter of minutes we could hear a few more of them nearby. As the meal got prepared, the moon rose and eclipsed all the stars in its brightness. Our sumptuous dinner included roast chicken, rice, salad and some more dates.\\n\\nWe ate like one big family and despite the language barrier with Hamada’s family members, we didn’t have any difficulty connecting with them. They played music and sang songs; we played cards together and ended our delightful evening with several cups of tea, boiled over the same fire that we sat cosily around. Even though there were tents, I decided to sleep under the open sky, huddled comfortably in my warm blanket.\\n\\nSand surfing\\n\\nI woke up at dawn to realise that the silhouettes from the previous night were in fact bright white chalky structures emerging dramatically from the sand. A few moments later, the sun rose from behind these limestone statues, turning the sky into a blaze of orange. This was one of the most breathtaking sights I had ever seen. We drove around this unique desert admiring this natural museum of statues shaped like chickens, mushrooms and cobras.\\n\\nThe White Desert of Farafra is certainly one of the most incredible landscapes I have seen. A few hours later, we drove out to see the Great Sand Sea, where one realises the enormity of the Sahara desert. We ran up and down huge dunes like excited children and climbed back up for some exhilarating sand surfing on a wooden plank before driving back to Bahariya.\\n\\nEgypt, unfortunately, is going through some troubled times and tourists are avoiding this country, making life difficult for people in the travel business. Our experience was nothing like the stereotypes propagated in the news. And everyone we met there asked us to go back and tell the world what the situation really is. The fantastic natural beauty, the rich history, and of course, the amazing people and their legendary hospitality made our trip to Egypt truly unforgettable.\\n\\n\\nFact file\\n\\nCurrency: Egyptian pound\\nLanguage: Egyptian Arabic\\nGetting There: EgyptAir has direct flights from Mumbai to Cairo.

       "  'Social evils such as female foeticide, witch branding and sex discrimination are still to fade away from the male-dominant rural society of Rajasthan. But, a village in this desert state has set a new precedent by shedding such taboos. Piplantri village panchayat of Rajasmand district has been saving girl children and simultaneously increasing green cover by their unique initiative of “eco-feminism”.\\n\\nTo mark the birth of a girl child in the panchayat, the family along with villagers celebrates the occasion by planting 111 saplings of neem, sheesham, mango and amla and the community ensures they survive as the girl grows up. Community even collects donation and puts Rs 31,000 in a 20-year fixed deposit scheme in a local bank to share the burden of parents and ensure the timely marriage of the girl.\\n\\nPiplantri panchayat has a population of 8,000 and villagers religiously follow rules introduced by their former sarpanch Shyam Sundar Paliwal, almost a decade back. Paliwal is proud of the measures he took as the sarpanch. Around 60 girl children are born every year in the village.\\n\\nPaliwal started the initiative in 2006 in memory of his daughter Kiran, who died after a prolonged illness. Around a lakh saplings have been planted so far and villagers protect them just like their daughters. The father is entitled to claim this amount at the time of daughter’s marriage. Before making the fixed deposit, parents will have to file an affidavit.\\n\\n“We make the parents sign an affidavit promising that they would not marry their daughter before the legal age, send her to school regularly and take care of saplings planted in her name. If the family abides by the affidavit, they are free to get the entire amount in fixed deposit,” said Paliwal, the brains behind the novel scheme.\\n\\nInitially, more than 50 per cent of the families in the village refused to accept the new model of “eco-feminism” introduced by Paliwal. Later, the panchayat members introduced the fixed deposit scheme to share the financial burden of the parents while marrying their daughters. The initiative, at many places, was linked to old religious customs where parents were educated about the importance of daughters and trees.\\n\\nA special committee was also constituted to enco\\xadurage and monitor the new initiative. The committee comprised villagers, a few former and present members of the panchayat, the village school principal and anganwadi members.\\n\\nPaliwal feels that no government campaign or scheme can ensure protection of the girl child in Rajasthan until the parents are provided with all social and economic security to take care and nurture their daughters.“In many villages in Rajasthan, a girl child is looked upon as a curse because her father has to give dowry at the time of her marriage. And they prefer a son as he helps father in earning his daily bread for the family. This was the reason we started making fixed deposit in the name of girl child in the village,” said Paliwal. “We tried to share financial burden of the parents and the idea clicked. The government should ideally work on similar model,” he added.\\n\\nOn their birthday, every girl along with other girls and women offer prayers to the trees. To prevent termite attack, residents have planted lakhs of Aloevera saplings around them. Now, they have become a major source of livelihood for many locals who market aloevera products like juice, gel and pickle.\\n\\nPiplantri has turned almost into an oasis and it is surrounded by a large number of trees. “My daughter is seven years now. I have seen these trees and my daughter grow up together. Initially, not all villagers agreed to follow the idea of planting 111 saplings. Now, it’s no less than any ritual in our village,” said Shantu Bhil, a tribal from Piplantri village.\\nAnother resident of Piplantri village said that it was for the first time he decided to bring up his daughter just like a son. Despite being a school teacher he never sent his daughter to a school.\\n\\n“I earn enough to support my family and educate children. I felt bad when I saw that families below my status were treating their daughters on a par with their sons. I felt guilty and now I have started sending my daughter to school,” said the schoolteacher. “I have announced not to take the fixed deposit money from the pancha\\xadyat and I am capable of marrying off my daughter,” he added.\\n\\nPaliwal is now running a campaign against alcohol consumption and cutting trees. He claims to have done significantly well, which is evident from the fact that no police case has been registered in Piplantri panchayat in the last 3-4 years.  At a time when state governments are spending huge amounts and campaigning hard to save girl children, the innovative model of Piplantri had a multi-dimensional impact on the social and economic life of its residents.\\n\\nWhile Piplantri has created history in Rajasthan, villages like Devra in Jaisalmer district in Rajasthan are known for their brutal approach towards girl child. In Devra village, no girl child was married for 108 years. However, just two girls have been married in the last 17 years.\\n\\nThe small village of Devra came to limelight when French freelance journalist Cilia Messier, penned a book “Seule fille de Mon Village” or “Single Girl of My Village,” which talks about the trend of female foeticide and girl infanticide in Devra village. In the gender-skewed society in the tiny hamlet with a population of 600-700, female foeticide or female infanticide is a centuries-old practice.\\n\\nHowever, one family that dared to break the practice of social evil was former sarpanch Indra Singh, who married his daughter Javan Kanwar in 1998 apparently after 108 years of any “baraat” coming to the village.Twelve years later, the second baraat came to the house of Panne Singh, the brother of Indra Singh for the marriage of his daughter Shagun Kanwar on February 16, 2010. It caught media attention which led to the penning of  “Seule fille de Mon Village”.\\n\\nAnother village in Sikar district has also come forward with new initiative to educate the girl child. The people in Ram Singh Ki Dhani have decided make fixed deposit of Rs 25,000 and use the funds for providing education to every girl child. The village has a population of 2,500 and initiative was taken a year back. Now, the deposit amount has touched Rs 60,000 and villagers have started a door-to-door campaign to ensure that every girl in the village goes to school. As a result, the enrolment of girls  has increased tremendously. All girls are given free uniform and books by the funds collected by the villagers.',\n",
       "  'A couple of months ago, 27-year-old Durgesh Kumari returning home with friends in Madanpur Kha\\xaddar’s JJ Colony in Delhi was chased by a miscreant. “I was gossiping with my friends and referred to someone as Laila. Soon the boy following us picked the word and started singing the song Laila O Laila...”\\n\\nIt was not surprising as it is predominantly lower middle class area and it is unsafe for women. But such incidents of eve-teasing and abuse are being reported from different parts of Delhi, including posh colonies and busy roads.\\n\\nDuring the recent Delhi Assembly elections, most candidates tried to score points and make their presence felt by focusing on “women safety”. But most women do not feel safe in Delhi. A few days back, a woman tagged along a friend to watch a play. Considering that Mandi House is a much safer area to walk late at night, they proceeded to the Bengali Market after the play, for dinner. While returning to the Metro station at around 10.30 pm, three young men on a two-wheeler crossed their path, making lewd comments. The faith in being secure in central and south Delhi was shaken!\\n\\n“Nowadays, learning self-defence is a must,” says homemaker Kanika Jain, a 41-year-old DLF Gurgaon resident. Jain’s concern for her teenage daughter’s safety has prompted her to think about enro\\xadlling her in self-defence workshops. “I have myself taken self-defence training, because one isn’t safe in any place. One day I went to my health club Vivafit, my gym manager told me about the self-defence workshop that was being planned and I decided to be part of it,” she adds.\\n\\nThis hints at how canny fitness centres have realised the potential of self-defence workshops and are encashing on the opportunity. On the other hand, NGOs working for women’s welfare have also roped in experts to provide different kinds of self-defence training to especially women who belong to economically weaker sections of society and are more vulnerable.\\n\\n“Once, while getting off a bus, a boy touched my hand and I couldn’t react,” repents 25-year-old Shahin who later participated in the self-defence training workshops organised by Agragami NGO.\\n\\nOne of these workshops was conducted by Martial Vout, a Swiss self-defence expert. Vout says: “What makes a woman strong is the way she asserts herself. The biggest challenge for me has been to make Indian women acknowledge that they can face incidents of attack, even from those who are known to them. So they need to empower themselves.”\\n\\nVout came to India first in 2008 “for a six-month holiday”. He says: “I chose this country because I had heard about its warm culture. But when I came here I realised that it wasn’t easy for women living in a patriarchal society.” He then decided to make frequent visits and use his knowledge in self-defence to train the Indian women.\\n\\nHaving attended workshops by him, Shahin feels: “The difference now is, I know when to react and when not to. When I don’t like something I have to show my anger!” While Shahin is pursuing bachelors in social work, Durgesh Kumari is a student of BA programme in DU’s School of Open Learning. Kumari adds: “It isn’t our fault to have not reacted. Our families always told us to ignore when situations like these arose. But now, I shout at men who tease and dare them to repeat this with anyone else. It is after learning self-defence that we realised how important it is to show our anger and protest against what is unacceptable and indecent.”\\n\\nThe thought echoes the impressions of Vout who uses his improvised self-defence technique to empower those who have limited resources. “We are mammals and like animals we have a natural way of fighting. There are often discussions about promotion of sports and martial arts but, according to me, the best way of defending ourselves is through self-defence.”\\n\\nHis defence techniques and its descriptive documentation are also available in the form of a book – I Can Defend Myself. Literature like this is benefiting both - women from the upper strata of society and the underprivileged in slums.\\n\\n“The self-defence tricks mentioned in the book need not require any special kick-boxing training, or a muscular body. These techniques are basic and natural and are, in fact, inspired from the way children and animals react at situations of fight or war.”  Vout suggests: “The mothers should be empowered first. Even today mothers tell their daughters to fix the buttons before they step out of the house.”\\n\\nThe frustration with the mindset becomes visible in his voice as he tries to explain his urge to work for the cause.The scenario is perhaps witnessing a change now. “Our teachers now tell us to inform elders if we face any trouble,” says 13-year-old Sukhrana. Her schoolmate Bharti adds: “Earlier parents used to stop us from going for tuitions since it gets late by the time we return. But now having learnt self-defence we feel confident and assure them that we will be fine.”\\n\\nWhen asked about India’s image abroad on crime against women, Vout says: “Even before the December 16 case, so many incidents had taken place but nobody spoke about them. Suddenly, one case caught the attention of all. I didn’t quite like how the western world painted India as an awful place to be in, because assaults happen everywhere in the world. The only difference between India and Europe is that in the West, if a woman is raped, the blame is on the assaulter and not the victim.”',\n",
       "  'Most people may not now recall the name of Budhia Singh. A few years ago, the little slum boy from Bhubaneswar had virtually taken the entire nation by storm with his achievements as a marathon runner. Now, the boy is in a government-run sports hostel in the city far away from limelight. He was enrolled there after his stormy separation from his coach and mentor, Biranchi Das, who is no more.\\n\\nNevertheless, Budhia may soon be grabbing the headlines again, thanks to Soumnedra Padhi, a young movie maker from Odisha who will release a film on the little marathoner titled “Duronto” which means without a stop.\\n\\n“It is a film in Hindi with English subtitles. Currently, the movie is in post-production stage and it will be completed by June-end. It will be ready for release thereafter,” said the film maker, who worked with a software company in\\n\\nHyderabad after his studies. Later, he shifted his base to Mumbai to do a basic course in animation and film making.\\n\\nThe movie, Padhi’s maiden feature film venture, is being produced by Code Red Films, an established ad film production house in Mumbai where the film maker had begun his career as an assistant\\n\\ndirector. Many documentary film makers, both from India and abroad have made short films on the wonder kid from Bhuba\\xadne\\xadswar. However, what encouraged Padhi to do a full-length feature film on Budhia was his incredible but equally controversial life.\\n\\n“It is fascinating how just a five-year-old child could run 48 marathons and equally horrifying how could he be allowed to do so for such a long time without being questioned. I think probably no other event in recent times created so much drama, controversy and entertainment as Budhia’s marathons,” said the film maker.\\n\\nThe movie is based on the relationship between Budhia and a judo coach (Biran\\xadchi Das) who had rescued the little boy from a Bhubaneswar slum and discovered his talent and how they achieved incredible heights together.\\n\\nBesides directing the film, Padhi has penned the script. But writing the script is not that easy. The shooting of “Duronto” began in October last year. However, prior to that Padhi and his team had spent a lot of time in Bhuba\\xadneswar meeting people who include Geeta Panda, the late Biranchi Das’ wife to do research for the script.\\n\\n“Writing the script was definitely challenging as there is so much to choose from,” Padhi maintained. As the film maker was from Odisha, he could contact the right people. The film maker has managed to rope in Manoj Bajpai, a well-known face in Bollywood, to play the important role of Budhia’s mentor and coach Biranchi Das. “Manoj has been a great collaborator for us. He got excited when we narrated him the script. I am immensely thankful for his trust in our team,” Padhi said. The Bollywood star had devoted a considerable time during the entire pre-production stage.\\n\\nThe role of Budhia is being played by Mayur, a relatively new child actor. “We wanted a child who was new and agile as the film required a lot of running. Mayur fitted the bill perfectly. We were very lucky to have discovered him,” Padhi said.\\n\\nThe child artiste along with other children in the film had attended a series of workshops prior to the film shooting. Another important role in the movie -- that of Budhia’s mother Sukanti Singh -- is being played by Tillotama Shome, an award-winning actors with many good films to her credit. They include Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding and Qissa with seasoned Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan which won her the best actress title in the New Horizons Competition of the seventh Abu Dhabi Film Festival.\\n\\nOther smaller roles in the movie are being played by a mixture of some non-actors as well as professional artistes from different places in the country.The film has been shot at different locations within Odisha and outside, including the temple town of Puri. Budhia had grabbed the limelight for the first time by running his maiden mara\\xadthon from Puri to Bhuba\\xadneswar, a stretch of 60 km, at one go.\\n\\nThe shooting of the movie generated a lot of curiosity among the people at all the locations. It sometimes became un-manageable, particularly in Puri where people actually thought Budhia had started running again. “We had to stop the shooting at times and seek the help of the police because it was difficult to manage the crowd,” Padhi said. \\n\\nMany biopics in the past had run into trouble before their release because of protests and objections from family members. But Duronto is unli\\xadkely to face such hurdles as the production team had already taken permissions from Gitanjali Panda (late coach Das’ wife) and Sukanti Singh (Budhia’s mother).“We had taken permission from both of them and were in constant touch with all others who were connected with Budhia before and during the shooting. We had also met Budhia but unfortunately he doesn’t remember most of the things now,” Padhi said.',\n",
       "  'The country is currently witnessing an unbelievable metamorphosis of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party. In his 49-day first tenure as Delhi chief minister over a year ago, Kejriwal had got stuck in the mass agitation track of Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement. Just as he completed the first 49 days of his second innings as CM, what we are witnessing is a completely different avatar of Kejriwal.\\n\\n There is nothing aam aadmi about Kejriwal’s second government. His ministry is packed with acolytes and he has designated the closest of them, Manish Sisodia, as deputy CM. When loyalty is the factor for rewards, there is no place for fair representation. He hasn’t bothered to have a woman representative in the ministry. There is no real commitment to simplicity, which is a basic article of faith of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\\n\\nMinisters are free to settle down in government accommodations of their choice and convenience. They are not really required to travel like aam aadmis: they are free to use official vehicles, and perhaps, in due course, with that status symbol laal batti atop their vehicles. They are allowed to take security cover, though advised not to go overboard.\\n\\nKejriwal has found that the statutory six-minister restriction (excluding chief minister) on the size of the Delhi ministry is an impediment to good governance. Like CMs elsewhere who often find it expedient to circumvent the constitutional restriction on the ministry size, Kejriwal too has resorted to appointing his legislators as parliamentary secretaries. He has decided to appoint as many as 21 legislators as parliamentary secretaries.\\n\\nHistory, however, tells us that these are but ways of accommodating more legislators in the government to ensure loyalty and stability of the political regime. Kejriwal enjoys a brute majority of 67 members in the 70-member Delhi Legislative Assembly. Though the overwhelming numbers would more than assure a comfortable full five-year term in office for the AAP government, history tells us that the numbers alone will not guarantee stability. Kejriwal can therefore be expected to face the challenge of fulfilling his legislators’ political ambitions. Obviously, he appears to be more sensitive to their aspirations as they alone can assure his grip over power.\\n\\nThat brings us to the other, more pronounced spectacle of these past weeks in the AAP’s organisational front. In a shocking display of cold-blooded purge, Kejriwal removed two tallest co-founders of the party – Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav - from all positions of responsibility and authority in AAP organisation. Their fault? They questioned him on various aspects of running the party in the run-up to the Delhi assembly elections.\\n\\nBhushan is the leader who has helped give the party the cutting-edge anti-corruption plank through his well-publicised public interest litigations and press conferences from the AAP platform. Whereas Yadav, using his socialist background and contacts with social movements and mass agitation groups in the country, helped ensure a wider appeal for the party. Probably, people like Admiral (retd) Ramdas and Medha Patkar would not have identified themselves with the party but for people like Yadav, who has also been the most articulate spokesperson for the party and widely acknowledged as its ideologue.\\n \\nNeither Bhushan nor Yadav ever projected themselves as a rival candidate for Kejriwal’s chief ministerial job. But being party elders and from a mass agitation background, who shared with Kejriwal the idealisms of transparency, simplicity, accountability and collective leadership as the defining features of the new party they launched, they could certainly be expected to question the functioning of the party and their Delhi government from time to time. They could be also expected to persist with anti-corruption advocacy, question the so-called crony capitalism with high profile attacks on big businesses, and toe a pro-poor line of thinking and action.\\n\\nBut now as the CM with a brute majority, Kejriwal has travelled a long distance from the agitational politics era of not too distant a past to a new phase of power politics. Assured of the legislative numbers to back free exercise of political power, Kejriwal perceives that this freedom will be severely restricted by men like Bhushan, Yadav and Ramdas and shackled by the party rules, regulations and institutions created at the time of the party’s founding.\\n\\nKejriwal and his acolytes invoked charges of indiscipline against the duo and got them shunted out of the party’s highest decision-making body – the national executive. The party rules require that the charges are referred to the party’s internal Lokpal, Ramdas. But Kejriwal and Co did not trust the Lokpal to do their bidding and simply bypassed the laid-down procedure while showing the door to the rebels. In fact, Kejriwal did not even spare the Lokpal. He too was shunted out on the cooked-up plea that his term had ended. There was a certain brazenness about these actions as it stunned the very people who had invested their commitment, time and resources to launch a party that was rooted in, to some extent, idealism.\\n\\nKejri’s authoritarian ways\\n\\nKejriwal was prepared for the consequence at the national level and in the states where it has orgnisational presence. Those disillusioned with Kejriwal’s authoritarian ways have moved out. He is ready for these. With his focus on Delhi, it doesn’t appear that he will focus on other states for now. Indeed, it was he who had rejected proposals from Bhushan and Yadav to contest last November’s assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, the two states where the party had pinned hopes ahead of the last year’s Lok Sabha elections.\\n\\nThe realist Kejriwal is now like any other average Indian politician, who is loath to democratic consultations with room for divergent voices and prone to concentrate power and authority in one man. Bhushan and Yadav may be wondering now how prophetic Hazare was when he advised them and Kejriwal against entering the “dirty” world of politics. But at that time itself, Kejriwal had no hesitation to dismiss his mentor’s advice against forming a new party. With the purge, Kejriwal has ensured those in positions of power in the Delhi ministry will also control the party organisation, with him as the sole supremo in both the government and the party.\\n\\nThis may not be good news for the Delhi voters who gave the APP such a huge mandate. For, a transformed Kejriwal may not deliver on many of the populist poll promises, though the political realist in him will blame all on the Modi government at the Centre and the BJP-led municipal corporations in the national capital. Kejriwal’s realpolitik approach may as well be: “Let’s divide and rule Delhi.”\\n\\nThe recent crisis in the Aam Aadmi Party ending in the purge of two senior leaders indicates that the fledgling organisation cares little for ideology, internal democracy or transparency, virtually its founding principles when it was formed not too long ago. Within weeks of storming back to power with an unbelievable 67 seats out of 70 in Delhi, the organisation is sounding like an average party without its lofty ideals and promises.',\n",
       "  'The new equations in the Aam Aadmi Party have made Ashutosh one of the important leaders of the party. He, along with Ashish Khetan played an important role in the ouster of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. Now, with party fast moving towards a centralised and personality based organisation, Ashutosh and others  are to play key roles in the party. \\n\\nThe former broadcaster spoke to Anil Sinha of Deccan Herald on the nature and extent of the crisis the AAP is currently undergoing. Though the AAP leader believes that the party will emerge stronger after this crisis, he acknowledges that present controversy has dented the image of the party.\\n\\nSome people have accused people like you and Khetan of playing a role in alienating founder leaders from the party leadership and in aggravating the crisis.\\n\\nI do not agree that I have, in any way, contributed to the crisis. There is no reason to believe that the conflict started because of me. This is basically a conflict between old views and new one. The people who have been socialists or ultra-lefts- Yogendra Yadav, Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha -were trying to control the party. But they should understand that the old ideologies have failed and do not attract people. All of them have been active in politics since long but could hardly make any impact. Now when the new politics has won, they want to hijack it.\\n\\nWhat do you mean by the new politics? Does it have any ideological content?\\n\\nYes, of course. It has its own ideology which believes in accountability, transparency and the participatory nature of the system. People want delivery, they want corruption free system. This is our ideology. This is what people were attracted to. This was the core ideology of Anna Hazare’s movement. We have won because we showed our commitment to the people that we would deliver on our promises to the people.  We promised we would provide them corruption-free administration and solve their daily life problems like clean area, water and electricity.\\n\\nSo, you do not consider it as a power struggle and a clash between personalities. Why it is that only few people have been targeted?\\n\\nNo, we cannot say that this was only an ideological war. Indeed, there was a power struggle and a clash of personalities. But these two things were only a smaller part of the entire episode. They (Bhushan and Yadvav) wanted to grab the party. Yadav and Bhushan were conspiring against Arvind Kejriwal to remove him from the post of national convener and install Yadav there.\\n\\nBut they (Bhsushan and Yadav) always denied it. You also could not produce any proof of the conspiracy?\\n\\nYadav was planting stories in newspapers and we caught him. Shanti Bhushan was openly expressing his views against Kejriwal. Moreover, Prashant Bhushan and Yadav campaigned against  party candidates in the  last Assembly Elections.\\n\\nHow could Shanti Bhushan declare that Kiran Bedi and Ajay Makan were better chief ministerial candidates than Kejriwal was? The Bhushan are not different people.\\n\\nAll of them campaigned against Kejriwal and the party. All of them are together. How can a party tolerate such things?\\n\\nBut people are not comfortable with your decision of removing the party Lokpal. Most of the people have disapproved the dismissal of former Navy Chief Admiral Ramdas from the Lokpal panel. How would you justify it?\\nHis term had expired…\\n\\nBut you had given him vital assignments after the expiry of his term?\\n\\nThat was a mistake. It does not mean you have to repeat a mistake.  The Lokpal should not have become a part of inner party conflict.\\n\\nHe should not have written a letter and when he had written a letter, he should not have leaked it to the press.\\n\\nThe people are comparing the happenings in your party with those of others such as the Congress and the BJP.  Why did you not give Yadav and Prashant the opportunity of being heard?\\n\\nWe have not done it the way it is done in other parties. Modi did not attend national executive meeting till Sanjay Joshi was removed. \\n\\nThe expulsion of the two AAP leaders was discussed twice or thrice in the  national executive. It was discussed in the national council meeting as well. They were in hopeless minority in the national council.  That is why they walked out from the meeting.\\n\\nWhat would you say on the audio-sting on Kerjiwal? Did he not use a filthy and abusive language against dissenting leaders?\\n\\nI do not consider these words as abusive. It is very common in north India. After all, the TV channels aired it. Had it been abusive, they would not have broadcast.  \\n \\nDon’t you think the controversy has dented the image of the party and the leader?\\n\\nYes. It has made an adverse impact on the morale of the party. The party will move ahead as the conflict of ideology is over. Our government in Delhi is working hard to solve the problems of the people.

       "  'Professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and eminent sociologist Anand Kumar actively participated in the historic movement of Jaiprakash Narayan and has taken active role in the rise of the AAP. He has been one of the most polite faces of the party since the beginning of AAP and everyone was surprised when Arvind Kejriwal was seen abusing him and Ajit Jha in an audio-sting. He told Anil Sinha of Deccan Herald that he is not ready to quit even after being thrown out of the part y national executive.\\n\\nHow do you see the entire drama which has been played out during the last one month in the Aam Aadmi Party?\\n\\nI see it as different phases of the politics of a movement which had started under the leadership of  Anna Hazare.  The first phase was characterised by the deceit on the part of the government on the issue of Lokpal-Ramleela maidan, assurance by parliament and later developments. The government deceived the people of the country and the AAP was born to carry forward the struggle for a truly democratic polity.  In each of the phases, we see a section of the leaders that refuses to move forward.\\n\\nWe all have seen how the party fought against the prevailing form of politics and won a state.  This was the victory of new politics. The party brought about an awakening among the people about their power.  People had accepted a party which was different in its mobilisation techniques. Here, there was no big money and no muscle power. People expressed faith in transparent and healthy democracy. \\n\\n Now, some people do not want to move ahead. They want to stay back.  They want to remain in Delhi, to limit them to a small region and wait till they showcase their model of development.  Others in the party want to move ahead and fulfill the aspirations of the people across the country. The movement has to spread, they believe.  \\n\\nBut the people who are opposing you in the party are portraying it as a conflict of ideology.\\n\\nThe current leadership of the party is deliberately distorting the fact and trying to give a different colour to the crisis. In reality, they want to hide the fact that they are not willing to fulfill the promises the party has made to the people of Delhi, the people of the country. There is no ideological conflict. Every one of us believes in the ideology of Swaraj, the Swaraj of Gandhi. This ideology requires self-discipline. It prescribes that you fight injustice through democratic means and people should keep direct vigilance over the administration.  \\n\\nSome are saying that the current crisis in the party has impacted its credibility among the masses. How do you assess it?\\n\\nIt is not the question of the prospect of a party. It is a question of people’s faith. The common people are upset over what is happening, they do not want this experiment to die. In fact, they are keen that we should resolve our inner-party problems.  They want this politics to grow.  They are really disappointed over what is going on in the party.  \\n\\nYou and Ajit Jha were part of the negotiations for the rapprochement between Yogendra Yadav-Prashant Bhushan and Arvind Kejriwal. What actually went wrong in the process?\\n\\nWe wanted to resolve it through negotiations and did our best. Yadav and Bhushan fully cooperated with us. Yadav even spent hours and hours till late night to find a solution. But Kejriwal was not ready to accept them. He was not even satisfied with the decision of sacking the two from the political affairs committee. He wanted to oust them from the national executive and from all the bodies and ultimately from theparty.\\n\\nWhat is the way forward? Will you people form a new party?\\n\\nThe movement is now standing on a big social base. It has created a phenomenal unity among the people. This unity has defied all the barriers based on caste, religion, region or gender. The people of Delhi have showed this unity. People across the country want this experiment to go on.  We have invited volunteers from across the country on April 14. The conference has been named Swaraj-Samvad(dialogue on Swaraj). Volunteers have to decide what should be done to move ahead.   The party does not belong to a person, it belongs to volunteers.',\n",
       "  ' After giving a few incentives to special economic zones (SEZs) under the recently announced Foreign Trade Policy (FTP), the Commerce Ministry is pushing for restoration of tax benefits to SEZs in order to make them more competitive and better placed for manufacturing and services exports.\\n\\nThe move comes after an evaluation of SEZs revealed that these units have not only contributed majorly to exports but have also directly employed close to 14 lakh people.\\n“SEZs need to be strengthened.

The society is moving towards digitisation,” he said. Tsaur said these devices and networks that connect, share, store and interpret data might need solid support from semiconductor companies. Besides the Rs 1.13 lakh crore Digital India initiative, the government is also working on the National Optic Fibre Network and National Knowledge Network. The government’s recent allocation of Rs 7,060 crore for developing 100 smart cities will propel the  growth of IoT.\\n\\n“We came to know that the government is moving towards shifting all citizen services to  a digital platform and here the country needs to move beyond 3G to 4G with additional capacity,” he said.\\n\\nSecurity a core focus\\n\\nOn the IoT space, Freescale is looking at the growing opportunity on secure and precise embedded solutions. “Here providing secure service is a challenge,” he said.Tsaur said as the security challenges arise at devices, gateways,  cloud systems, and big data, companies will have to provide different levels and types of security.\\n\\n“In the embedded systems, most people talk about security like co-connection and re-protection. Then comes encryption and decryption. But the technologies are moving towards Bluetooth,  6LoWPAN (IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks) and CB2 with various IP addresses. Here Freescale is the only company capable of these security management solutions,” he said.\\n\\nFreescale also predicts that IoT will result in profound changes in the way enterprises operate and the products they produce and consume. “IoT opens up inexpensive connectivity to various devices and couples this with the power of the cloud and Big Data analytics to enable enterprises to reduce costs, optimise resources, create new products, and explore new business models,” he said.\\n\\nThe economic impact of IoT is estimated at between $14.4 trillion and $19 trillion, says IDC. He said, “Currently we have opened an excellence centre in Shanghai to cater to the growing demands of the Asia-Pacific region. And if the demand is growing in India, we might look at the opportunity and be part of the Make in India campaign.”\\n\\nFreescale has a 1,000-strong employee base in Noida, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.',\n",
       "  \"Tata Motors, India’s largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles, recently held the second season of the T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship 2015 at the Buddh International Circuit (BIC), Greater Noida.\\n\\nTata Motors has brought this popular sport to India as a T1 Truck Racing Championship under the aegis of the FIA (Federation Internationale de l’Automobile) and FMSCI (Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India).\\n\\nTruck racing is new in India. The sport began in the United States at the Atlanta Motor Speedway on June 17, 1979. In the last few years, truck racing has earned a higher profile, and currently over 30 teams regularly compete for various championships. Races kick off from a rolling start, and commonly last from eight to 12 laps. It is a non-contact sport. All drivers must hold a race licence issued by the Motor Sports Association, or the national motorsport body from the driver's country.\\n\\nT1 Prima Truck Racing Championship 2015 proved to be an exciting one, drawing huge crowds to the circuit just like it had last year. Spread over two days — Saturday, March 14, and Sunday, March 15 — the venue, teams, and participating drivers did not see many changes from last year. But the race-specs of Prima trucks went through a host of upgrades incorporating the learnings from Season 1.\\n\\nTrucks 700 kg lighter\\n\\nMaking all the difference, the trucks were now 700 kg lighter with a lower ground clearance and a re-tuned suspension setup. The engines witnessed a 10 per cent improvement in performance, producing 370 HP of power and with a top speed of 130 km/hr (monstrous for a five-tonne weighing truck). Braking performance was also enhanced with the new pressurised water tanks added at the back to cool off the brakes. In this race, there were 12 custom-built Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Prima model trucks. To drive them, there were 12 British drivers. There were 16 laps around the 5.13 km-long track.\\n\\nCompared with Europe, trucks on the Indian track featured less power and raced at lower speeds. Last year, speed was capped at 110 km per hour. This time it was raised a tad to 130 km per hour. Last year’s race stretched over 15 laps. This time it was extended to 16. The vehicle's weight was reduced accordingly.\\n\\nIt was thrilling to see experienced drivers manoeuvre their way around the track, roaring majestically as their feet stepped on the gas pedals. In all, six teams participated in the race: Castrol Vecton, Cummins, Tata Technologies Motorsports, Dealer Warriors, Allied Partners, and Dealer Daredevils. Each team had two trucks, adding up to 12 drivers.\\n\\nOn the race day, it drizzled at the BIC. Very large-sized trucks trying to overtake each other on the straight and curved bends often collided, adding energy to the raw competitive intensity. The noise from the five-tonne trucks seemed to add to the frenzy of the race lovers.\\n\\nAnxious moments\\n\\nDefending champion Stuart Oliver from team Castrol Vecton, a 51-year-old driver, emerged the champion this year as well. But not before he was given some anxious moments when Steve Thomas of Team Allied Partners topped in the qualifying race on Saturday, and secured the pole position.\\n\\nSteve dominated the eight-lap Super Qualifier race on Sunday as well. But once the drivers got into the thick of action in the 16-lap final race, there was no stopping Stuart Oliver, despite the wet conditions. Steve Thomas of Allied Partners and Steven Powell of Tata Technologies Motorsports took second and third place respectively.\\n\\nFor Season II WABCO, JK Tyres, Cummins, Castrol and Tata Technologies were the main sponsors. WABCO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jacques Esculier told           Deccan Herald that the company showcased its reliable, fine-tuned systems on the participating trucks.\\n\\n(The author attended the T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship 2015 at the Buddh International Circuit (BIC), Greater Noida, at the invitation of Tata Motors)\",\n",

Consequently, we expect the RBI to hold rates in April policy and track progress on policy transmission to lending rates, evolution of the monsoon, impact of unseasonal rains and international developments,” according to a note by ICICI Bank.\\n\\nOn balance, given our CPI projection of average 5.2 per cent (YoY) in FY2016 along with the RBI’s comfort level of real policy rate of 1.5-2 per cent, we continue to expect an additional 25 bps reduction in the repo rate by end-June 2015,” ICICI Bank added.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India will be releasing the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2015-16 on Tuesday, April 7. The central bank had cut repo rates in March as well as in January by 25 basis points.\\n\\n“We believe that an April rate cut would be too soon especially after two consecutive out of turn decisions. The March decision was possibly the one that was brought forward from April, based on information on fiscal position. The next cut will be on incremental data, mostly on inflation. We maintain our call for a June rate cut but given RBI's  penchant for delivering surprises, another off-policy-date decision cannot be fully ruled out,” Kotak Economic Research said in a note.\\n\\nHDFC Bank, however, believes that Rajan may spring in a surprise by cutting rates in the April meet. “We believe however that the case for a rate cut, sooner rather later, still remains. The governor could cut the repo rate by another 25 bps at the review, failing which, a rate cut is likely later in April most likely after the retail inflation print for March is out in the second week of April,” HDFC Bank treasury research team said in a note.\",\n",

The land was acquired to form a layout for the economically weaker sections of the society.\\n\\nApplied for conversion\\nHowever, one-and-half years after the final notification, Nataraj’s name surfaced when he applied for diversion (conversion) of land use from agriculture to non-agriculture. On April 18, 2005, the Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district issued the diversion order. The survey sketch of the land prepared by the Bengaluru Urban district authorities showed that the land was vacant when the order for land diversion was passed. The land continues to remain vacant.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a few people approached the High Court against the land acquisition. The court said that the cases of those who have constructed buildings on the land considered for acquisition should be treated sympathetically.\\n\\nWith regard to Sy No 1/3A and adjacent piece of land, Nataraj, along with three others, approached the High Court. The court sought the status of the land. The BDA submitted in its April 9, 2008, report that the land could be dropped from layout formation as 25 houses had come up there. The court said, “The government is directed to pass an appropriate order formally in line with the report filed by BDA, expeditiously, before first week of June 2014, failing which, it shall be deemed that the lands of the petitioners have been deleted from acquisition proceedings.”\\n\\nIt is not clear whether the government passed any order, but a controversy erupted recently when an assistant executive engineer of the BDA filed a field report stating that the land was empty and a layout can be formed there. Based on his report, the BDA decided to go ahead with the formation of a layout comprising 31 sites of 600 sq ft each. The BDA entrusted the layout formation work to contractor B N Mallikarjuna at an estimate of Rs 12.81 lakh.\\nAs soon as he started the work, a man by name Rajkumar came there, threatened the labourers and drove them away. He abused the contractor and BDA assistant engineer N Vishwanath for taking up the work. The engineer lodged a complaint at the Banashankari police station on April 1, 2015.\\n\\nSources said BDA officials have invited trouble by giving false report on the status of land as having 25 houses, which may amount to contempt of court.\\n\\nNataraj has no answer\\nWhen contacted, Nataraj said that the land belonged to him as it had been deleted from the list of acquired land. On being asked about his name surfacing when he applied for diversion of land use, he said he had bought the land from Chikka Revanna even before the acquisition of land by BDA.\\n\\nHe, however, could not answer why the final gazette notification for acquisition showed Chikka Revanna as the owner of the land when it belonged to him.',\n",

       "  \"The dramatic killing of a female PU student inside a college hostel recently has clearly exposed the dark side of a decision taken unilaterally by college managements: A total ban on mobile phones in college campuses and hostels that leaves girls at the mercy of outsiders, even to communicate with their parents!\\n\\nInstitutions, both public and private, are guilty of this questionable decision, ironically taken to protect girl students from rapists and other anti-social elements! Despite parents repeatedly voicing their strong opposition to this, the rule has continued with an ‘official’ stamp! Will the recent murder episode force a rethink on this ban?\\nMahesh, the attender who gunned down 18-year-old PU student, Gauthami at the Kadugodi-based Pragathi college, had been her parents’ only communication link to their daughter. He controlled their access to her, since no student was allowed to use a phone on her own. Therein lay the fault, a critical gap cleverly manipulated by the accused. \\n\\nOut of sight, out of touch, parents are often anxious about their daughters staying in distant hostels. Mobile phones, that now ubiquitous mode of communication, would have clearly kept them in touch, whenever, wherever. Not having access to it could lead to misuse and manipulation by intermediaries, as proven by the recent case.\\n\\nHouse panel recommendation\\nUntil now, the debate has been totally one-sided. In July last year, a House committee of the State Legislative Assembly had recommended the ban in all schools and colleges, although parents had serious reservations. The panel’s rationale: Mobile phones lead to a rise in rapes and endanger women’s safety.\\n\\nThe panel’s advice was fully backed by the State Women and Child Welfare Committee, which reasoned that the excessive use of the device would keep the students hooked to social media. No thought was apparently given to the phone as a safety device. What if a smartphone with proven safety apps actually helps prevent a crime?\\n\\nThe rule has been so strictly enforced that several college managements have confiscated phones, refusing to return them till the students complete their course. Here’s what Sneha Ashok, a city student, upset over this regulation has to say: “Children are the most important people in parents' lives and it is their right to be able to communicate with their wards. Institutions cannot stand in the way.”\\nSneha’s observation finds an instant echo in what Azra Sidhan, mother of a daughter, says about the whole issue: “In today’s world, being in touch means talking to your loved one on a mobile phone. Although there are a few negative effects, banning its use in hostels is not the answer.”\\n\\nNo clear rules\\nDoes the State Pre-University Department have clear rules that mobile phones be banned in all PU colleges? There is an apparent ambiguity about the existence of any such written law in the rules and regulations. But, according to the PU department director Sushma Godbole, phones are “conventionally” banned in all colleges.\\nC K Ram, principal of a government PU College, says although the ban on mobile phones is a known fact in all PU colleges, it is not clear whether there is anything like a written rule.\\n\\nIn 2009, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had brought in a proposal to restrict the use of mobile phones in schools not only for students but also for parents and teachers. Most CBSE schools do not allow their students to use phones within the campus. However, there is some leniency shown on the request of parents, especially for students of higher classes.\\n\\nAlternative arrangements\\nIn residential CBSE schools such as the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, there are certain set rules. For instance, at the JNV, Bagalur, phone booths have been placed separately for boys and girls in dormitories and near the warden’s residences. These are used to by students only under the supervision of wardens.\\n\\nStudents are allowed to make calls only during certain fixed hours, either in the afternoon or evening. Outstation students could call from the office phone once a week, again only during fixed timings. A warden’s phone can be used only in case of emergencies.\\n\\nHere’s what the school principal, B Venkateshwaran has to say about the arrangement: “CBSE has banned the use of mobile phones in all 593 schools all over the country. However, we have made our own separate alternative arrangements for students.”\\n\\nWhat the police say\\nAdditional Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) Alok Kumar feels even in the Gowthami murder case, a dedicated landline could have avoided an intermediary like Mahesh. “Banning mobile phones is a subjective matter. But there is no denying the fact that there should be a communication link for students and parents. A landline could have sufficed,” he contends.\\n\\nHowever, adds Kumar, the mobile phone too could be a distraction for youngsters. “But when students are moving around all alone outside, the device could have its benefits. Within the confines of a hostel, a landline could work well,” says he. City police commissioner, M N Reddi declined to comment, although he indicated that the lack of a direct communication link could have played a role in Gowthami’s murder.\\nIn September, 2009, the State Department of Collegiate Education had come out with a circular banning use of mobile phones in all 357 government and 299 private aided degree colleges. This ban was applicable across Karnataka, and was binding even on teachers and non-teaching staff.\\n\\nBut there was a difference. The phones could be carried as long as they were in silent mode. The Commissioner of Collegiate Education had clearly stated that the managements could confiscate the phone even if it rang once.\",\n",
       "  'There is no blanket ban on use of mobiles at the graduate and post-graduate levels, but there are restrictions and conventions on how to use the phones. Lecturers who teach at the pre-university, degree and post-graduate level themselves say there is no uniform policy on mobiles, while there are informal regulations and understanding between the teachers, administration and the students.\\n\\nTheir contention is that there is no clear policy on mobiles at any level and that there is ambiguity on the use of mobile phones at the pre-university, degree and even post-graduate levels.\\n\\nProfessor Sudha Sitaraman, who has taught in colleges in Bengaluru says that she has never seen circulars issued to students not to use cell phones inside the campus. “Given the way social interaction is in today’s globalised world, there is no way you can block students from coming into campus with phones,” she says.\\n\\nHowever, the teachers expect students to switch off the phones when in the class room. “We also expect students to be sensitive in not using them while walking in the corridors or around the teachers’ rooms. If this is followed, the atmosphere is fairly cordial and does not disturb the sense of learning in the institution.”\\nSitharaman says the mobile phone cannot be banned in today’s world of instant communication. “There cannot be a ban on cell phones after the way in which society has changed. There can only be some regulations on where and when phones should be used. We haven’t come across any government decision to have a policy for use of mobiles and we haven’t received any such circular. Each college deals with the situation differently. There is no policy on mobiles in Karnataka, for instance.”\\nOn the shooting incident in Bengaluru that killed a PU student, Sitharaman says the issue is not one of use of mobiles or not. “The killing has nothing to do with the phone. It has to do with the nature of the relationship - we have to investigate why the relationship went the way it did, not about whether the killer or the victim was using cell phones. That is purely a statist response. The nature of the relationship is independent of the means and device you use in an interaction. A history of their relationship alone will tell us how the entire episode came to be.”\\n\\nDattaterya M, Associate Professor says there are conventions on mobile phone use, but they are not very strict and formal. “We expect students to put their mobiles on silent mode when they are in class, during seminars or important events. We haven’t had a policy from the state government on how mobiles should be used once they are brought inside campuses. At our campus, we have never had any problems so far.”\\n\\nThe associate professor is certain that “there is no question of making or receiving calls when in classroom. Still, sometimes there are a few backbenchers who play with the mobiles. We ask them to walk out of class so they don’t disturb other students and it will be a lesson to all others who choose to do that. Overall, it is not possible to impose a blanket ban on cell phones as the nature of social interaction has completely changed globally.”\\n\\nSrihari Menon, a city degree college student says: “We should be allowed to bring in cell phones in to the campus, but not to the classroom. I agree with regulations on when and where the cell phone has to be used inside the campus. A ban altogether is harsh.”\\n\\nMaithrey Kumar, who has just moved from PU to a degree college, says: “Cell phones should be allowed inside the campus, but not inside the classroom. Our college also has frequent checks by squads, so I don’t bring my phone into the class room. We have been provided with lockers to keep our phones. So we use the phones only after we finish class. That’s a good idea, and is also feasible.”',\n",

Should they allow students to have more and frequent channels of communication with their parents or guardians? Questions such as these become even more important when we talk about residential schools and colleges.\\n\\nMahesh K, the attender who shot Gauthami K, the II PU student, had been working and living in the institution for a full two years. During this time, he had earned the full trust of not only the college management but also parents of students. The critical link: His mobile phone, used by students and parents to communicate with each other. \\n\\n“Mahesh was a very good person who would frequently go out of his way to help students and us, parents by acts like procuring medicines when students got sick and also serving as a link of communication between us and our children,” recalls the parent of a class 11 girl student studying in the school, preferring anonymity.\\nAt the same time, there was a side to Mahesh as a strict enforcer of rules that the students had to follow.  Despite being only an office boy, he would often exceed his brief and act as the warden dictating terms and conditions to students. “We had often complained about Mahesh’s behaviour to the school but it was not really taken seriously,” says another parent.\\n\\nOn his part, Mahesh had easy access to all parts of the college. There was no particular restriction imposed on his movements.\\n\\nFollowing a series of rapes in schools in the city, the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) had brought in rules limiting interaction between students and non-teaching staff in schools. Although not related specifically to limiting such interactions between students and a college’s staff, Sushma Godbole, Director, PU department told Deccan Herald that a number of safety guidelines had been issued back in 2012 for colleges.\\n\\nThe college, according to its chairman Soma Singh, had installed 160 cameras and had never received any complaints about Mahesh. However, police investigations have revealed that the college had flouted various safety rules and also failed to perform background checks on Mahesh before hiring him.\\n\\nLink between parents, students\\nWhat was the situation that brought Mahesh not only close to the students but also their parents?\\n\\nWhile mobile phones were not allowed within the college for students, they would use an office phone to call their guardians and parents once if not a few times a week. However, with over 225 students -- both boys and girls staying separately within the institution --, this arrangement was clearly not enough.\\n\\nConsequently, they had no choice but to resort to easier means like using the phone of school stafferr or lecturers. This, according to parents, was a convenient arrangement. This was also known to the college management.\\n\\n“Our children would often give us missed calls on our phones from Mahesh’s phone and we would call afterwards. We had raised the issue of installing more phones with the college’s management but this was also not heeded,” recalls a parent.\\n\\nDid they feel uncomfortable about their children using Mahesh’s phone, at any point of time? “We did not hesitate at all in using Mahesh’s phone. A number of our children would use his phone for 20 and 30 minutes but he never minded,” the parent says.\\n\\nMost schools and higher secondary institutions, whether affiliated to state or central boards, have a rule that imposes a blanket ban on the usage of phones within the school’s premises by students. However there are also opinions that claim this rule should be relaxed. “In this day and age, where the use of phones is unavoidable, I think there is a need to evolve a system where there is regulated use of such devices,” notes B Venkateshwaran, principal of the CBSE affiliated Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Bagalur.\\n\\nAVINASH SHASTRY\\nJournalism student\\nCollege managements should understand that mobile phones are a necessity for students, girls in particular, to keep in touch with their families in an emergency.\\n \\nSNEHA ASHOK\\nGraduate student\\nChildren are the most important people in parents' lives and it is their right to be able to communicate with their wards. Institutions cannot stand in the way.\\n\\nPAVAN KUMAR M K\\nStudent of BA\\nMobile phones symbolise personal freedom and that's exactly what students want. Banning use of gadgets thinking it would affect their studies is a byproduct of primitive thought.\\n\\nSUDHA SITHARAMAN\\nProf of Sociology\\nThere cannot be a ban on cellphones after the way in which society has changed. There can only be some regulations on where and when phones should be used.\",\n",

One got a hint of this in the first film when good cop Brian (Walker) joined outlaws Dom and Co, after falling for Dom’s sister, Mia (Brewster).\\n\\nAfter 3 disappointing sequels, the films were back on track, following the stupendous success of Fast Five and Fast and Furious 6. Surprisingly, Dom’s partner Letty (Rodriguez), who ‘died’ in the next four films, returned in F&F6 with selective amnesia. Through the course of the six films, we have come to expect that the core team of the franchise is almost super-human, and even as the plots get lame, the stunts only get bolder, such as the remarkable heist in Fast Five or Owen Shaw’s tank crunching cars in Fast and Furious 6.\\n\\nMaking the seventh film wasn’t to be easy, for Wan replaced Justin Lin (who had directed the last four F&F films). With Paul Walker, a lead integral to the series, ironically dying in a car accident, one question was what would happen to Brian? Fortunately, Walker gets a fitting tribute in his last film, even if the plot is nonsense.\\n\\nF&F7 is actually two plots. Following the events in F&F6, Owen’s brother, Deckard Shaw (Statham) vows revenge on Dom and gang. Dom has to nab Shaw before it’s late. A second plot introduces well-known stars, Kurt Russel, Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond) and Tony Jaa (Ong Bak). Russel stars as Frank Petty, a ‘Nick Fury’ sort who enlists Dom’s gang to nab a Somali terrorist Jakande (Hounsou) as well as rescue Ramsey (Emmanuel) who has invented a gadget called ‘God’s Eye’ that can track a person’s whereabouts.\\n\\nPetty convinces Dom that the gadget can be used to track Shaw, except that Shaw arrives to attack Dom and co, device or not. F&F7’s best action scene occurs in the beginning, stupid as it might sound, of several cars skydiving and falling on ground safely. Amnesiac Letty knows her kicks and punches, but forgets that she is married to Dom. Even sillier is the fight when Brain takes on Kiet (Jaa), a martial artist and kills him. Two-time Oscar nominee Hounsou is wasted as a villain, and Statham gets the scraps when it comes to dialogue.\\n\\nHobbs (Johnson) takes the backseat as Petty calls the shots.If there’s a good reason to watch F&F7, it’s for the marvellous way Walker’s death has been handled.

The film shows him alternating between a powder keg, its fuse and the daringly careless spark that lights the fuse. However, Sushant Singh Rajput’s portrayal of a somewhat eccentric, dog-with-a-bone on a mystery and not-quite-Bengali Byomkesh Bakshy in the eponymous film is overshadowed by Dibakar Banerjee’s handling of the project.\\n\\nHere’s a film whose every department is worth studying. From the story to its pacing to the characters to the overall noir tone, from the dialogues to music that never encroaches upon the storyteller’s territory, and yet adds to it, “Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!” (DBB) is a tour de force that will both keep you rooted to your seats and blow you away.\\n\\nIt begins with a young Ajit (Anand Tiwari) enlisting Byomkesh’s help to trace his missing father Bhuvan Banerjee. Byomkesh teams up with Bhuvan’s landlord Dr Anukul Guha (Neeraj Kabi) and begins unravelling the knot, one clue at a time. Along the way they meet politician Gajanan Sikdar, his nephew Sukumar and niece Satyavati (Divya Menon), as well as Gajanan’s mistress Angoori Devi (Swastika Mukherjee).\\n\\nWhat begins with a missing man soon snowballs into something much bigger, where each character has a mask — sometimes without knowing it. In the end, Dibakar Banerjee manages to pull off with Saradindu Bandyopadhyay’s most famous character something that can be compared to Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat’s endeavour with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s most celebrated creation. Bits and parts of multiple stories converge with an entirely new one to make for a cinematic experience to remember!\\n\\nA special mention here for Neeraj Kabi, who has done absolute justice to his role(s).

       "  'Technology hardware companies are not exactly the darlings of the investor community. Despite the size and heft of the leaders among the pack, many analysts paint a picture of low-margin, high volume business, while others derisively refer to them as box sellers. IBM sold off its desktop business — which began the PC revolution — to Lenovo some years back.\\n\\nPummelled by years of low valuations at the bourses, Michael Dell took his namesake company private. It took a boardroom coup for HP to overcome the convulsions created by a CEO who wanted to dump the company’s hardware business. On the storage side, EMC and NetApp are finding their legacy business and size a liability in responding to young challengers.\\n\\nSurely, hardware sounds so Old Economy and definitely boring? But amid all this, Deccan Herald recently stumbled on two nimble-footed hardware operators with Indian pedigree, which seem to be doing some pretty exciting work, innovating in their niches, and growing their business by spades. One of them, Nimble Storage, is a NYSE-listed Silicon Valley-based company founded by Indian American professionals; and the other, Netweb Technologies, is a New Delhi-based unlisted, family-owned firm.\\n\\nIt pays to be focused\\n\\nBoth are highly focused in a few niches. Nimble is purely a storage company, and within that offers a mix of flash- and disk drive-based breakthrough offerings that combine performance as well as capacity at aggressive price points. Netweb Technologies operates in the three areas of supercomputing (which it calls high performance computing or HPC), storage, and servers. In all three verticals, its unique value proposition (UVP) is the offer of specs, pricing, and tailor-made solutions.\\n\\nNimble was founded by Indian Americans Varun Mehta and Umesh Maheshwari. Varun had previously worked in NetApp and was one of the first employees of EMC DataDomain. Umesh has a PhD in storage architecture from MIT. The itch which led them to found Nimble was their discovery that traditional storage companies made customers buy different types of storage for different uses.\\n\\n“With virtualisation, customers are able to bundle multiple applications onto a single, server platform. They discovered that something similar was just lacking on the storage side,” Radhika Krishnan, vice president for product marketing of Nimble Storage, told Deccan Herald. The company was founded in 2008. Radhika claims traditional storage giants find their historical business a drag on inventing new things.\\n\\n“Take the example of NetApp. When you have a file system architecture that was invented about 20-25 years ago, it’s just not modern enough to accommodate all the newness of flash to be retrofitted on top of it. It’s kind of like laying the foundation of a single-storied house constructed about 20 years ago, and then suddenly wanting to convert it into a skyscraper. There’s really no way to make that work,” says Radhika. Nimble chose flash drive to lay the foundations for its storage architecture.\\n\\nFor Netweb, HPC brings in about 40 per cent of its annual revenues. The rest is equally split between servers and storage. Netweb has around 250 HPC installations, mostly government research and development (R&D) labs.\\n\\nIn high-end servers, it has marquee names like Juniper, Infosys, etc. as customers. Infosys is Netweb’s customer for OpenStack, a line which was started a year back. “You can build your Hadoop installation based on OpenStack. Infosys found our solution very, very competitive and  we were able to deploy it for them,” Sanjay Lodha, chief executive officer of Netweb Technologies, told Deccan Herald. In storage, Netweb offers what it calls a “complete storage solution, i.e. unified storage”. Sanjay said, “In unified storage, the same storage is able to meet all the growing needs of the organisation. It can act as a NAS (network attached storage), and can act also as a SAN (storage area network). One can start with 16 terabytes and can scale up to four petabytes.”\\n\\nGrowth has been a breeze\\n\\nNetweb is a zero-debt high growth company. Revenues for the financial year ended March 31, 2015, were around Rs 100 crore, Sanjay said. It grew at around 30 per cent last year. In fiscal year 2015-16, Netweb is targeting to grow 50 per cent to achieve revenues of Rs 150 crore. The CEO said the company enjoyed net profit margins of around 8-10 per cent. Interest from investors was high, but as of now there are no plans to dilute the family’s 100 per cent equity, the CEO said. “We have thought about listing. But we are not very clear on it. We have been getting lots of interest from equity investors. At this point, we want to increase our valuation. Until we become a Rs 500-crore company, it’s very difficult to take out much,” said Sanjay. He is targeting to reach the goal in another five years.\\n\\nNimble went public in December 2013 by listing at the NYSE. In the financial year which ended on January 2015, it logged revenues of $227.7 million and grew 81 per cent year-on-year. But the searing growth has come at the cost of margins and profits. Its non-GAAP operating margins were a negative 17.1 per cent for fiscal 2015. GAAP net loss for fiscal 2015 was $98.8 million, compared with a net loss of $43.1 million in fiscal 2014.\\nInnovate to stand out\\n\\nInnovation is part of the DNA of both the companies. Nimble had a good reason for selecting flash as its storage medium. One thinks of storage usually as disk drive. Flash, however, is semiconductor-based storage. As Radhika explains it, “Any time you had a spinning disk, there was actually time involved with the mechanical parts moving and the rotor accessing the right kind of data...there would be delay extracting the data and retrieving it...so that problem no longer exists with flash because it is all semiconductor-based. It tends to be very, very fast. That’s the UVP of flash.”\\n\\nNimble then went beyond flash. “We essentially use a combination of the flash drive and the disk drive. Both have strengths and weaknesses. We capitalise on the strengths of both to give customers the very high performance that they need without compromising capacity,” Radhika said. This allows Nimble to be very aggressive on price.\\n\\n“We offer five  times the price performance of an EMC or a NetApp. If a client needs six racks of EMC gear to support X number of customers, they are only going to need half a rack of Nimble to support the same customers,” she claimed.\\n\\nSanjay mentioned an innovation that Netweb did for its HPC computing clients using Big Data analytics. “For Vodafone, we did segmentation. A user in Delhi may be re-charging for around Rs 100 a month. So immediately after he recharges, a second SMS goes out to him saying if he recharges for Rs 200, instead of Rs 100 now, he gets Rs 50 talktime extra. And he is likely to recharge since he thinks about the benefit he is getting out of it. This second SMS is a complete analytical solution. It is designed and provided by us. It’s not a product that can be given to everybody. But something that we customised for Vodafone. It’s called Big Data stack,” he said.\\n\\nIt pays to be first\\n\\nBoth Nimble and Netweb claim to have some unique capabilities. When Netweb bid for C-DAC, Pune’s PARAM Yuva II supercomputer tender a couple of years ago, it was the only Indian company to qualify, along with IBM and HP.\\n\\nProbably its previous experience of installing a supercomputer at The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, in the 1990s, helped. Netweb’s tender offer of around Rs 20 crore for 400 machines that made up the supercomputing system proved a winner, considering that the cost itself came to Rs 35 crore, according to Sanjay.\\n\\nHe said Netweb designed and provided complete end-to-end installation. Today, the benefits are available to everybody in the form of improved weather predictions, he pointed out.\\n\\nNimble’s claim to fame is to hit the market first with an on-demand storage service. Radhika explained, “Let us say you had 20 customers this month and the following month 10 of those customers go away. We will only have you pay for the actual amount of storage that your customers use.”\\n\\nIn this way, Nimble allows its customers to shift paying for storage from a capital expenditure (capex) model to an operating expenditure (opex) model. The advantage is that opex can be expensed from the topline.\\n\\nTapping the cloud push\\n\\nThe push towards cloud hits hardware makers both ways. On the one hand, as small businesses shift to the cloud by renting space, the demand for on-premise servers and storage would decline. At the other side, demand for servers and storage should increase from cloud providers. This sounds simple enough, but it’s easy to get trapped at the wrong side of this churn. Both Nimble and Netweb seems to be handling the transition well enough.\\n\\nRadhika said, “We now have 500 cloud service provider customers out of the total 5,000 that we now have. They are buying Nimble gear, and in turn, are offering cloud services to their customers.”\\n\\nNetweb is following a slightly different model. While not providing a cloud platform in general, it is seeing great traction in its new business of offering high performance computing for rent which it offers from Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh. “Pharma companies and oil and gas companies want HPC machines for limited functions for a short-term. There’s so much demand that there’s a waiting period of 15-18 days for people to get a log-in access to our system,” Sanjay said.\\n\\nIn storage, it’s identifying high-end functions for big businesses which they would always want to keep in-house. For instance, post-production work by broadcasters and movie studios. Files from a film shot using multiple cameras are all dumped into one machine. Scores of people may want to access same files at the same time for editing. Netweb makes it possible by providing the storage and software infrastructure. “Such work will never shift to the cloud,” Sanjay says confidently.\\n\\nFirst-mover advantage\\n\\nNimble Storage\\n\\nClaims to be the first to offer storage on demand\\n\\nHow it works    How it happened\\n\\nAssume a cloud provider has\\n20 customers\\nAssume 10 of those went away the next month\\nNimble only charges for actualstorage consumed\\nThis allows the client to shift from capex to opex   \\n\\nNetweb Technologies\\n\\nClaims to have pioneered supercomputer installations in India\\n\\nHow it happened\\n\\nC-DAC called for tenders to upgrade PARAM Yuva \\nNetweb had previously installed a supercomp at Chennai\\nIt beat IBM and HP to win the C-DAC tender\\nIt designed, installed 400 machines for PARAM Yuva II\\n\\nRadhika KrishnaN, VP for product marketing, nimble storage: If EMC had the luxury of being able to start from scratch, if they could afford not to worry about their VMAX, VNX, ViPR, DataDomain and all of that, then they might be able to do what we have done five years from now.\\n\\nSanjay Lodha, CEO, NETWEB TECHNOLOGIES: We have some very big MNC competitors in the spaces we operate. But we have our own value proposition. It is very difficult for somebody to match our specs and pricing. Where they try to restrict capacity, we provide unlimited user licence.',\n",
       "  'The announced rollout of the Apple Watch on April 24 provides the right peg to take a look at the state of the smartwatch and the larger wearables market in India. The country is not among the select nine geographies where Apple is releasing its watch initially. But make no mistake, the rollout is going to create more than a few ripples in one of the world’s fastest growth markets for smartphones.\\n\\nCompetitors have already signalled their intention to fight it out to maintain their turf. Smartphone makers like LG, Samsung, and Motorola have launched compatible smartwatches priced much lower than the Apple Watch (priced between $350 and $17,000), while brands such as Spice and Kenxinda have brought out even cheaper models.\\n\\n“The Indian smartwatch industry is still at a nascent stage and has immense potential to grow in the coming years. With the increasing acceptance of smartphones in India, individuals are now looking at wearables as the next big thing,” Tata Elxsi Chief Designer (Product Design) Shyam Sunder B K told Deccan Herald.\\n\\nSamsung, Sony lead market\\n\\nA smartwatch has two parts — one is ‘smart’ and the other is ‘watch’. “The first refers to the intelligence which enables the connection and extension between a human and his/her watch, which a traditional watch does not possess. The watch part is about time and about tradition which have been there for scores of years, albeit in a diminished form during the last 20 years as the mobile phone, particularly the smartphone, captures the market,” Huawei President (Consumer Business) Allen Wang said.\\n\\n“Huawei’s wearable category has three product types: TalkBand, InfoBand and watch. Huawei just announced TalkBand B2 and N1 and the Huawei Watch at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) which has attracted global spotlight. Most probably, the TalkBand will debut in the Indian market in Q2 FY16, and later, we will unveil the smartwatch in early Q3,” Wang said.\\n\\nAccording to 6Wresearch, the Indian smart wearable market shipment value reached over $3 million during CY H1 2014. Estimates say that in the next 4-5 years, India could see a smartwatch market size of over Rs 20 crore. Samsung and Sony have captured around 85 per cent of the current market share.\\n\\nSamsung’s leadership stems from the demand for its Galaxy Gear series. In January 2015, Sony India announced its new SmartWear Experience range — SmartWatch 3 and SmartBand Talk — in India. Both wearable devices connect with Lifelog, a tracking app.\\n\\nExperts have found a correlation between the popularity for smartwatches and smartphones. Indians adopted smartphones as a must-have device at a rapid pace. Utility gave way to trend, which made space for status, with smartphones bloating in features, prices, and flaunt value. Smartwatches might follow the same direction.\\n\\n“Wearable products will help people balance their smartphone-user behaviour and guide them to use it in a healthy way. Currently, it cannot be an alternative to smartphone completely, as it will take time for wearables to provide the same function with the same experience. As technology develops, wearables will revolutionise the smartphone,” Wang said.\\n\\nA smart future?\\n\\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) Senior Market Analyst Karan Thakkar said, “The very reason why smartphones excelled because they enabled consumers with more mobility. Smartwatches go one step further. Very soon the concept of wrapping a phone around your arm while working out is going to fade away. Devices which can be paired with smartphones can notify about important calls or messages, at least.”\\n\\nThe country’s IT and R&D talent pool has played a role in developing, assessing and improvising wearable solutions. “There are lots to explore in wearable technologies, not just in smartwatches. Tata Elxsi has been involved in designing cutting-edge wearable products in collaboration with a few Indian companies. We work in various areas including health, security, communication, and beauty. Also, we are working on designing and developing new value features that can be incorporated in wearables, than the usual accelerometers,” Shyam Sunder said.\\n\\nHe added, “The main challenge for R&D...is to make the wearable devices look sleek, miniaturised, compact, and at the same time, fashionable and offer all the required functions, which is crucial, especially if companies are getting into the fashion accessories space.”\\n\\n Studies show that the Asia-Pacific market is expected to propel the global market, supplemented by China. Many smartwatch makers believe that India will become a hub for the product.\\n\\n“As a country with the second largest population and a top smartphone market, India will also become the biggest smartphone country. We believe in the huge potential of the Indian smartwatch market and will start focusing on this market from the very beginning. So we will start the journey now,” Wang said.',\n",
       "  'Ferguson, Missouri-based Emerson Electric Company is a $24.5-billion multinational electrical equipment major which  manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial, and consumer markets. In an email interaction with Deccan Herald’s Umesh M Avvannavar, Emerson’s president (India, Middle East and Africa) Pradipta Sen talked about how the company is making the most of its presence in India.\\n\\nWhat investments have you made in India till date? What are the challenges you are facing?\\n\\nIndia is a significant region for Emerson. Over the past three years, we have invested over $400 million into our India operations. Emerson has operated in India since the 1980s and now employs over 10,000 people. We have more than 100 offices here, 16 manufacturing plants, and five global engineering centres. We take both a global and local view of India. Over the years, we have developed a large engineering talent base that now successfully serves our global operations.\\n\\nFor example, we have invested heavily in the Emerson Innovation Centre in Pune, which is engaged in product development and engineering solutions for various Emerson businesses worldwide. It employs over 1,000 engineers with nearly 500 invention disclosures. More than 270 patents have been filed by Pune engineers.\\n\\nFrom a local perspective, we have invested significantly in manufacturing capacity and life-cycle service. Over 90 per cent of what we sell in India is domestically produced. Like all companies, we also face challenges. Finding the right talent is always a challenge. There are certain regulatory and policy hurdles that currently deter multinational companies from developing and investing in end-to-end product development value chains in India.\\n\\nWhat are these regulatory hurdles?\\n\\nIndia has well-developed engineering, research and development (ER&D) capabilities, but the investments in this area need to grow for supporting growth in domestic manufacturing.\\n\\nAt $44 billion, India invests less than one per cent of GDP in ER&D versus two per cent in China and nearly three per cent in the United States. Multinational companies operating in India currently see benefit in investing only in the engineering aspect of ER&D, given the current policy scenario in India.\\n\\nMultinationals would feel encouraged to invest in developing complete ER&D ecosystem in India if every part of the product development process, leading to commercial-scale manufacturing, is treated at par and incentivised equally. Investments in developing the complete ER&D ecosystem would not only go a long way in boosting domestic manufacturing but would also position India as a global hub for manufacturing development, perhaps at par with software.\\n\\nHow many acquisitions have you made in India? How have they benefited the company?\\n\\nDuring the 1980s, Emerson entered into joint-venture relationships with several Indian-owned companies. Over the last few years, Emerson has made six acquisitions or joint venture buyouts that positively affected the company’s business. One of our most recent acquisitions is of Virgo Valves in 2013.\\n\\nVirgo has a very strong reputation in the marketplace, complemented by a very strong Indian manufacturing base. We are seeing benefits from this acquisition every day, in terms of our ability to offer solutions to diverse sectors from oil and gas, metals and pharmaceuticals, to food and beverages. We’ll continue to be on the lookout for acquisitions which make business sense. We believe in an ideal mix of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. The companies that we acquire bring in their own identities and track record of success. Emerson helps by adding its brand, its management expertise, technology, scale, and global reach.\\n\\nWhat are the future investment and expansion plans of Emerson in India?\\n\\nMany sectors including oil and gas, water and waste treatment, cold chain, manufacturing, construction, etc. are bound to grow significantly in India. We are prepared to manage this growth in terms of the solutions to be provided, and resources to manage it. Emerson will continue to be committed to invest and grow our businesses here. Our strategy is to focus on local manufacturing, product development, and business support facilities and provide innovative and mission-critical technologies to support fast-growing industries across verticals.\\n\\nHow do Emerson’s products and services benefit the industrial and commercial markets?\\nEmerson provides innovative solutions for customers in industrial, commercial, and consumer markets around the world. The company has five business segments: Process Management, Industrial Automation, Network Power, Climate Technologies, and Commercial and Residential Solutions. Emerson Network Power protects and optimises critical infrastructure for data centres, communication networks, and information and data systems. At Emerson Industrial Automation, we provide products, solutions, and services that drive factory automation to greater heights.\\n\\nEmerson Climate Technologies is the world’s leading provider of heating, air conditioning and refrigeration solutions for residential, industrial and commercial applications. Emerson Process Management helps process and power generating industries better manage their plants through intelligent control systems, measuring instruments, and regulation and control devices. Our solutions help reduce project risk, lower project costs, shorten overall project schedules, and allow plants to start up earlier to help maximise the return on investment.\\n\\nWhat are the new product/service offerings by Emerson?\\n\\nWe are a leading provider of wireless technologies applied to industrial sector and these offerings have gained a lot of traction. A majority of Indian process industries, such as those operating in beverages/liquids, pharmaceuticals and offshore oil and & gas production, etc. are adopting wireless technologies in highly complex plant operations. They are applying Emerson Process Management’s Smart Wireless solutions for measurement, tracking, automation, and maintenance purposes.\\n\\nWireless technology basically enables industrial customers to monitor processes in places where wired connections are impractical. From monitoring oil pipelines in the desert where soaring temperatures and sandstorms can damage wired connections, wireless innovation has enabled industrial efficiency in the toughest of environments. With wireless, a plant’s power costs go down, while accurate measurement and tracking help in more efficient functioning. Emerson Climate Technologies reinforced its position as a leader in the HVACR (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) segment by being the first to indigenously develop a compressor which runs on the environmentally-friendly R290 refrigerant. The R290 is being used by some of the largest beverage manufacturers in India.\\n\\nWhat, according to Emerson, is important while talking about smart cities?\\n\\nWhen would a city be truly smart? A smart city is an efficient co-existence and convergence of institutional, social, physical and economic systems and infrastructure that ultimately enhance the quality of urban life. In a smart city, each of the systems (institutional, social, physical, economic) will be self-sufficient and sustainable and would be designed for efficient inter-system interaction. Timely access to basic resources like water and electricity, implementation of systematic processes like planned-garbage-disposal and real-time traffic diversion and reliable infrastructure like communication networks and mass-transits would form the backbone of such superior systems.\\n\\nUnfortunately in an average Indian city today, most of the basic systems are present in a rudimentary manner. As an example, take the city water lifecycle. Potable water as a basic resource faces supply crunch in peak summer months, insufficient waste water recycling processes lead to unnecessary wastage, and absence of rain-water drainage and harvesting infrastructure wreaks havoc in the rainy season. A smart city would continuously evolve and respond positively to needs and changes of its citizens.\\n\\nWhat is your market share globally? What are your plans to ramping it up?\\n\\nEmerson recorded sales of $24.5 billion in 2014, maintaining a CAGR of 4 per cent for sales in the last five years. We do not disclose our market share.\\n\\nHow does Emerson see itself growing in thermal power sector?\\n\\nIn power generation, there is a substantial demand for the adoption of supercritical steam technology. This is driven largely by the need to minimise the environmental impact by achieving higher efficiencies of energy conversion. Power generation by coal as a fuel is around 55–65 per cent of the total power generation in India. Emerson’s offerings include state-of-the-art plant control systems, wireless measurement devices, and machinery health management systems for supercritical thermal power plants.\\n\\nPlease elaborate on investments made in R&D globally?\\n\\nBehind Emerson’s progress in industrial technologies is an expansive network of R&D professionals that identify issues before they become problems. Emerson Advanced Design Center (ADC), based in Columbus, Ohio (USA) within the Battelle Memorial Institute campus (whose labs operate the largest R&D consultancy in the United States), focuses on developing and maintaining a ‘go-to’ network of external resources to assist in new product development for Emerson’s global businesses. The centre’s main objective is to gather a world-class group of experts who can analyse a project before it gets off the ground and assess technical risk.',\n",

       "  'The objection raised by Justice Kurian Joseph, a judge of the Supreme Court, to the holding of the chief justices’ conference on three days including Good Friday is valid. Justice Kurian Joseph is a practising Christian and Good Friday has great religious significance for all Christians. The conference has been held, but the issue raised by the judge in his letters to Chief Justice of India H L Dattu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is still relevant.  The judge did not attend the conference and the dinner hosted by the Prime Minister on Saturday. It was not just Justice Kurian Joseph who was unhappy about the holding of the meeting on a day important for Christians.  A senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, Lily Thomas, had brought the matter to the attention of the chief justice, who unfortunately challenged her to file a petition in the court on it. \\n\\nThe chief justice’s reply to Justice Kurian Joseph also amounted to a rebuke. He told the judge to strike a balance between the needs of the institution and family commitments because “institutional interest should be given preference to individual interest”.  It was wrong to posit the issue as one of making a choice between official responsibility and personal convenience.  A religious holiday is not only a personal occasion but a collective right of a community. The CJI said that high court chief justices would have had to skip work on one day if the meeting had been scheduled for another weekend and such meetings have been held in the past on other religious holidays. This is not sufficient justification, especially when a participant has expressed his unhappiness and opposition.  Justice Kurian Joseph said in his letter that a constitutional institution like the judiciary, expected to protect secular ethos, cannot even remotely give any message otherwise. The issue is not even whether such a wrong message was intended, but that it has been taken as wrong.\\n\\nThe judge’s position and sentiments are also an expression of the growing concerns and apprehensions of religious minorities over their rights. He has made it clear in his letter to the prime minister when he underlined the need ‘’ to show equal importance and respect to the sacred days of all religions’’.  It should be noted that secularism as conceived and practised in India is not separation of religion from the state but equal regard for all faiths. The issue actually goes beyond the holding of official functions on a holiday.  It is also about respecting the rights, freedom and sensitivities of minority communities in every way.',\n",
       "  ' Bharat Arun, the assistant coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, said the primary aim of the team this season was to be among the top four teams, and enter the knockout stages of the Indian Premier League.\\n\\nThe former Indian pacer exuded confidence that the Royal Challengers have the wherewithal to accomplish the task. Excerpts:\\n\\nTell us a bit about the RCB’s goals for the season?\\n\\nIt’s exciting, and obviously a big challenge. There have always been a lot of expectations on RCB, and getting to the top four of the IPL is a big challenge. We have some world-class bowlers, and many of them have done well in the World Cup. At the same time, we have also quite a few Indian bowlers, who are really talented. So, the challenge will be to prod them to give their best.\\n\\nYou have interacted with almost all the Indian bowlers during your NCA tenure. How helpful will that be?\\n\\nIt is an advantage. Having watched them and interacted with them in the past has helped me create an awareness about their mindset. I\\u2008believe a coach should understand the mindset of the bowlers to make them perform well. That way, yeah, I have a huge headstart.\\n\\nHow do you make a bowler bowl to the needs of T20?\\n\\nWhen you are executing the plans in T20, you have to be spot on as a bowler because batsmen will always be on the look for runs. The other aspect is handling the pressure because it is even more tough to execute your plans under pressure. So, you need to learn to keep the pressure away, so the challenge would be to make bowlers focus on the task.\\n\\nThis is your first coaching stint in IPL. Would your experience with the Indian team help to tackle the pressure?\\n\\nI always wanted to be a part of an IPL\\u2008team. But I could not take it up because of my assignments with NCA and others. So, it’s exciting and challenging. I have told myself that I will come to an IPL game only when I\\u2008am a coach of a team, RCB’s opening match (against KKR at Kolkata on\\u2008April 11) will be the first IPL game I will be watching from the ground.

       "  'Delhi Daredevils, during their seven year IPL journey, have merely flattered to deceive. Even during their successful runs, they haven’t gone beyond the semifinals. To make it worst, for the last two seasons they have failed to shake themselves from the bottom place. The worried franchise, therefore, went on an extravagant shopping spree at the auctions in February and hope for a reversal of fortunes in the eighth edition.\\n\\nThe squad has undergone expansive changes for the new season. Big names like Yuvraj Singh, brought for a whopping 16 crores, alongwith Angelo Mathews and Zaheer Khan have been roped in.\\n\\nGary Kirsten, who made his maiden IPL foray as Daredevils head coach last year, admitted to have smartened after the wretched season. The team, in 2014, could win just two out of their 14 matches, in a worst ever performance by a team in IPL. In 2013, they could win just three out of their 16 matches.\\n\\nThe restructured Daredevils have a new captain in Jean Paul Duminy. The all-rounder had a good World Cup, and is among the handfuls to be retained from last year. Duminy, apart from coach Kirsten, will have plenty of South Africans to assist him in Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel. Even the Daredevils’ newly appointed bowling coach is a former South African pace bowler Alfonso Thomas. Kirsten called him “one of the best exponents of T20 bowling in the world.” Yuvraj will be the mainstay of Daredevils’ batting.

       "  'Recently the Minister of Power, Coal and Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal reassured the commitment of the Central government in achieving the target of 1,75,000 MW of green energy by 2022. “By evolving innovative ways of funding these projects and with attractive power purchase agreements” he is confident to reach this high target.\\n\\n As our neighbour China is struggling to cope with the smog and air pollution in cities like Beijing, it is heartening to know that our leaders are keen to charter climate friendly technology with emphasis on clean and renewable energy sources to fuel the engine of development. It is pro-active, and has potential of realising the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide energy to millions of people who are deprived of electricity connection.\\n\\n The Centre aims to generate 1,00,000 MW of solar, 60,000 MW of wind power, 10,000 MW of biomass and 5,000 MW through installation of  small hydro power projects. To implement these targets, it is estimated that around Rs 2,50,000 crore would be required.\\n\\n Obviously, the investment costs are very high and while setting the targets, the government has not clarified the modalities for funding, where this is going to be generated. One option is to stake claim on the funds from Clean Development Mechanism through international funding. Second option is to raise internal finances through National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF). The finance minister has raised the clean energy cess on coal from Rs 100 to Rs 200 per tonne. The cess would generate Rs 30,000 crore annually to be used for setting up clean energy projects. However, NCEF is already sitting with Rs 17,000 crore and is unable to fund projects as it lacks mechanisms to implement the idea.\\n\\n The power purchase agreements to be evolved by the private investors in clean energy sectors may attract corporate funding. Nevertheless, other financial institutions like public and private sector banks need to play proactive role in providing venture capital to develop green projects.\\n\\n In addition to the financial resources, there is the problem of developing technical skills to set up and maintain these projects. It is estimated that this sector will generate employment opportunities for about two lakh skilled people. But we have no plans to develop these technical skills in the near future. Lack of technical skills is the main reason for failure of solar installations in the rural areas over the decades.\\n\\n A close analysis of the performance of solar power sector in India over the years indicates that we are nowhere near achieving the targets that were set by the solar missions. In 2010, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission had set the target of generating 20,000 MW connecting to the grid power by 2022. The present government has increased it to five fold with a promise of generating 1 lakh MW by the same time.\\nWind mills, hydro projects\\n\\nBy the end of 2014, the country was able to generate a meagre of 3,000 MW of solar energy. Will it be possible or even feasible to add another 97,000 MW in the next eight years? In order to set up one 1,000 MW solar power plant will require 10,000 acres of contiguous land. In the dense populated regions of the country where are we going to find such land for captive solar power plants?\\n\\n Similarly, setting high target of wind mills and small hydro projects needs to be reviewed through existing experiences. There are confirmed reports of declining populations of rare bird species of Great Indian Bustards in desert national park, Rajasthan due to high number of windmills. Large number of wind mills in one locality might cause changes in the micro climate.\\n\\nThe destruction caused by the construction activities of small hydro in the tributaries of Ganga in Garhwal has led to the catastrophic Kedarnath floods.   A series of small hydro projects is the main cause for destruction of the remaining natural forests in Western Ghats. The performance of green energy projects needs to be assessed in the light of these ground level experiences and the targets need be set realistically.\\n\\n By setting up unrealistic targets, the green energy is bound to attract those who are keen to reap the windfall profits rather than generating power. The ongoing solar scam in Kerala is an indicator of how the green technology will be misused by the politicians. In Karnataka, the Surya Raitha scheme of providing solar irrigation pumps has already run into problems. The super fast enrollments of 295 farmers online in seven minutes have raised doubts about the foul play in implementing this innovative project.\\n\\nThe capital intensive green technology to connect the centralised grid power will be dominated by corporate and political nexus. Instead, the emphasis should be on the propagation of decentralised off grid green technologies that need minimal funding, controlled, and managed by the communities.',\n",

The traffic congestion caused severe inconvenience to public.\\n\\nAround 300 to 350 lorries travel from Dakshina Kannada to Bengaluru on Charmadi Ghat daily. The axle of the lorry broke down on the 10th cross at the Ghat.\\n\\nHearing the news of the congestion Banakal police station officer Shivakumar, Kottigehara Geleyara Balaga team visited the spot and made way for the movement of vehicles. “In a hurry, the vehicles didn’t follow the lane discipline resulting in congestion. Moreover, the density of the vehicles is also high on the Charmadi Ghat stretch, resulting in frequent traffic congestion,” said an eye witness. “We were caught in the traffic at the seventh curve on the Charmadi Ghat at 7 pm. We were hoping to clear the congestion by one hour. However, when no vehicles came from opposite direction till 10 pm, we were worried. Children were crying in the buses.\\n\\nThe district administration should have deployed squads to clear the traffic when the density of vehicles is high on the stretch,” said Manjunath from Ramnagara.',\n",

The liturgy of the Easter Vigil began at 7 pm at the outer surface of the church.\\n\\nThe lights were put off, when the fire was lit. With the blessing of the new fire, the Paschal Candle was lit and it was carried inside the church.\\n\\nAs the Paschal candle was placed on its stand in the sanctuary, the lights in the church were switched on.\\n\\nCathedral’s assistant parish priest Fr Mahesh D’Souza, chanted the Exsultet, also called the “Easter Proclamation”.\\n\\nThe celebrations for the Easter Vigil was the Liturgy of the Word, wherein four readings from the Old Testament were taken up, each followed by a responsorial hymn and prayer by the main celebrant. The Liturgy of the Word comprised of four readings from the Old Testament: The story of Creation from the Book of Genesis; Crossing of the Red Sea from the Exodus; a passage from Isiah and another from Ezekiel. This was followed by a reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Romans and the Gospel passage taken from St. Mark.\\n\\nAfter singing ‘Gloria’ accompanied by ringing bells and the main church bell, two readings from the New Testament were read.\\n\\nIn his homily, Bishop Gerald Lobo emphasized the fact that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after being crucified is the foundation of the Christian faith.\\nThis faith is strong and resolute. The Apostles who were filled with fear after the crucifixion of Jesus, experienced the Risen Christ and became bold and vocal, and began to spread the good news, the Bishop said.\\n\\nAfter the homily, the water was blessed following the recitation of the Litany of the Saints by Wyalan Machado. Once again, people lit their candles as they renewed the Baptismal Vows following which the Bishop and priests sprinkled newly blessed Holy Water on the congregation.\\n\\nAt the end of the solemn Easter Mass, Cathedral rector Fr Stany B Lobo extended the greetings of Easter to all and invoked the blessings of the Risen Christ on all the parishioners.',\n",

Twenty years on, over 10 percent, that is, 2,860 people, had developed Type-2 diabetes.\\n\\nBoth meat and dairy products contain saturated fat, but certain saturated fatty acids are particularly common in dairy products.\\n\\n\"When we investigated the consumption of saturated fatty acids that are slightly more common in dairy products than in meat, we observed a link with a reduced risk of Type-2 diabetes.\\n\\n\"However, we have not ruled out the possibility that other components of dairy products such as yoghurt and cheese may have contributed to our results,\" Ericson explained.\\n\\nThe researchers took into account many dietary and lifestyle factors.\\n\"However, there may be other factors that we have not been able to measure. Moreover, different food components can interact with each other.\\n\\n\"Our results suggest that we should not focus solely on fat, but rather consider what foods we eat.

Gold nanoparticles are known for their extraordinary efficiency at absorbing and scattering light.\\n\\nWhen a few drops of blood serum from a finger prick are mixed with the gold nanoparticles, certain cancer biomarkers cling to the surface of the tiny particles, increasing their size and causing them to clump together.\\n\\nHuo and her team developed a technique known as nanoparticle-enabled dynamic light scattering assay (NanoDLSay) to measure the size of the particles by analyzing the light they throw off.\\n\\nThat size reveals whether a patient has prostate cancer and how advanced it may be.\\n\\nAlthough it uses gold, the test is cheap. A small bottle of nanoparticles suspended in water costs about $250 (Rs.15,000) and contains enough for about 2,500 tests.\\n\\n\"Because it is low-cost, we are hoping most people can have this test in their doctor\\'s office.

       "  'It is an agreement of few agreements and several disagreements, but a promising agreement nevertheless.\\n\\nWhen the last round of nuclear talks between Iran and P5+1 powers failed in November, pessimists said it was all over. The optimists said ‘better talk than walk’. Now, all the parties involved have walked the talk to a framework agreement. There is certainly more talking and walking before a final deal can be signed, but there is ample time for it until June 30.\\n\\nFor now, however, the focus should be on a mission half complete that started 12 years ago, with war threats rearing its ugly head several times in between. At least four winners emerge out of this – the West led by the United States, Iran, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and the anti-West Russia-China camp.\\n\\nFirst, from the perspective of the West, which demonised Iran’s nuclear programme, the agreement ensures that the Islamic Republic is less likely to be a nuclear threat in the future. Additionally, Iran will also not be able to quickly produce a nuclear weapon. Washington has said it would “cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.” More importantly, the checks are significant. If Iran deceives, the world powers would have at least one year to counteract, including reimposing sanctions.\\n\\n Second, Iran is assured of relief from sanctions. Though the timing has not been specified, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations would lift curbs that are hurting Iran’s economy. This has been a key agenda for Tehran. The agreement also allows Iran to partially, but formally, return to the international milieu after decades.\\nThe price that Iran has to pay is sacrificing about two-thirds of the 19,000 uranium-producing centrifuges that may be used to fuel a bomb. It has also agreed not to enrich uranium over 3.67 per cent — a lower level than is required to make a bomb — for at least 15 years.\\n\\n There will also be no enrichment at the underground Fordow site for about 15 years. And the main reactor at Arak — which is capable of producing plutonium, another key ingredient for making a weapon — would be redesigned and the spent fuel shipped out of Iran. As a compliance measure, Iran will allow for “the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear programme.”\\n\\nAfter all this, Iran will still not have to close any nuclear facility altogether, which is a concession that it has won after much bargain. President Hassan Rouhani said Iran will abide by the terms of the agreement so long as the West does too.\\n\\nThird, the Gulf Cooperation Council countries – which feared nuclear and ideological threats – now have one worry less.\\n\\n While the six-member bloc will see the agreement as compromising its own interests, it is time for them to prepare for political-security reconciliation. It is in the interest of the GCC countries to develop a constructive engagement plan with a more internationally acceptable Iran than seek further estrangement on Sunni-Shiite ideological grounds.\\n\\n The West was Iran’s main foe. Tehran sought to complicate issues in West Asia to strengthen its bargaining power. With this agreement, Tehran may now be more amenable, even compelled, to play a stabilising role in the region.\\n\\nThe GCC countries must tap this opportunity to bring order in Syria and Yemen, apart from approaching other problems in the region, including the Islamic State in a new spirit of cooperation. King Salman of Saudi Arabia has “expressed his hope that a final binding deal would be reached to reinforce the stability and security of the region and the world.”\\nStand of Russia, China\\n\\nFourth, Russia and China — key supporters of Iran and crucial parties in the negotiations, but conspicuously quiet since the agreement was announced, — are winners too. Any agreement or disagreement by Iran on any matter would have naturally been arrived at only after Russia and China were taken into confidence. Iran needs their backing to show that it is on firm ground and to justify its stance.\\n\\n For example, reports suggest that Russia and China opposed the West’s proposal wanting the United Nations Security Council sanctions to be automatically reversed if Iran violates the agreement. This signals a fresh impetus for an emerging multi-polar system. No, this is not a moment to run down a ‘weaker’ United States for signing an agreement with Iran. Rather, it is time to cheer a more ‘reasonable’ and ‘accommodative’ United States under President Barack Obama.\\n\\n There are, no doubt, important issues that remain unresolved like the possible lifting of a UN arms embargo and agreement on the technical sections of the deal which could cause problems during the talks until June end.\\n\\nThe GCC countries will demand safeguards. Israel has already said that a final deal has to include a “clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel’s right to exist”. Iranian hardliners have said Tehran has surrendered too much in exchange for too little. And, there will be political war in the United States.\\n\\nBut if most, not all, commitments, issues and assurances do find a place in the comprehensive deal, all the parties will secure through diplomacy what neither war nor sanctions could ever have accomplished.\\n\\nIn the end, no nuclear weapon and no war means it is a win-win for all the concerned parties and the world at large.\\n\\n(The writer is a Dubai-based political analyst, author and honorary fellow of the University of Exeter, UK)',\n",

       "  \"There are turf wars beyond the high wall of Tihar Jail as well. Jail gangs operate like the drug lords in the outside world.\\n\\nPerhaps, the only distinction is that they deal in tobacco and strike fear using innocuous-looking surgical blades. Their aim is not to just settle score, but also to dominate the jail economy.\\n\\nTobacco, banned inside the capital's Tihar jail, is a powerful commodity.  \\nRival tobacco-peddlers have their areas clearly demarcated, and an encroachment often means broken bones and slashed faces.\\n\\nJail mafias are always on the lookout for innovative ways to smuggle tobacco in. Sometimes it is packed in condoms, which are meant to be swallowed and later vomited out.\\n\\nAnother popular way of smuggling tobacco is to hide packets of tobacco in the rectum.\\nOnce the contraband is smuggled into the jail, it also serves as a strong currency.\\n\\nUsing tobacco, inmates can make others do their work, be it washing clothes, getting a body massage or even sexual favours.\\n\\nIf traded for money, a packet of tobacco comes for at least Rs 500. In times of short supply, the prices go up.\\n\\nTobacco traders are either themselves bladebazz (those who wield surgical blade) or are friends with those who are. Using a blade is the surest way to retain turf.\\nThe wounds that the surgical blades leave behind are shallow, but cause a great deal of bleeding.\\n\\nInnovative methods\\nGetting blades inside the jail is little more risky than smuggling tobacco. One of the popular ways of smuggling in a blade is to attach it to a long piece of thread and then swallow it, but with the other end tied to a tooth. Some conceal them in the soles of their shoes. Only few are experts at it.\\n\\nIncidents of blade attacks are more of a routine than exception.\\nAt least 18 cases of such attacks were reported in 2013.\\n\\nTihar authorities say that tennis balls and socks are also often used to smuggle in blades, mobile phone parts and drugs. The banned items are  hidden inside the ball and flung across the compound wall from the Jail Road outside.\\n\\nNets have now been installed on unguarded jail walls to stop this.\\nUsually, smuggling of banned items through the gate is difficult because of multi-layer checking by Tamil Nadu Police.\\n\\nIn September 2014, two jail wardens Narender and Mukesh Tanwar were also suspended on being accused of providing SIM cards to inmates.\",\n",
       "  \"By the time boys in this Delhi village turn 13 or 14, many of them begin pestering their parents to rechristen them. They prefer names like ‘Fauzi’ and ‘Balraj’ to their “unexciting” names.\\nFauzi and Balraj, leaders of warring gangs, belonged to the Mitraon village in Najafgarh. Mitraon is located just six kilometres from Dichaon Kalan, the native village of Bharat Singh, an ex-MLA who was shot dead a few days ago. Notorious for gang wars, Mitraon has seen over two dozen of its men killed in less than two decades as gangs led by the two clashed with each other over a few acres of land.\\n\\nBut as men fell to rival gangs’ bullets, Fauzi, Balraj and a few others turned into “legends” for the younger generation in Mitraon. Now, as boys climb the teenage ladder, they begin idolising these gangsters who have left behind them a trail of crime and hatred in this village.\\n\\nAs years went by, the gangs multiplied. According to different estimates, there are 12-15 small and big gangs – with their origins in Mitraon – operating in the Najafgarh area. The smallest of these gangs consist of at least four members. The bigger ones such as those led by the likes of the notorious Naveen Khati have over 50 men.\\n\\n“Young members belonging to big gangs broke off to start their own small gangs with two or three other criminals as soon as they committed a crime of note or displayed great courage,” says Inder Singh, a retired government school teacher in Mitraon.\\n\\n“The village lacks ample job opportunities and the youngsters realise they can earn big money and live the lavish life if they take to crime. They also dream of a political career through this route,” adds Singh.\\n\\nThe availability of plenty of property in these rural regions of Delhi promises big money to these criminals who readily indulge in land-grabbing. Apart from that, there is plenty coming in from businessmen in terms of extortion as the community offers little resistance to the gangsters. “Kamzor dil waale (those with a weak heart)” are the general targets.\\n\\n“In our village we do not keep count of innocents killed by the gangs. We are too occupied counting the deaths of our village men, killed by each other,” says a resident Ishwar Singh. Since New Year's Eve, six persons belonging to Mitraon village have already been killed in gang wars.\\n\\nBelieved to be at least two centuries old, the  village is not a friendly place despite its name which means welcoming to friends. After Bharat Singh’s murder, SLR-armed policemen have been deployed at five locations in this village. The streets wear a deserted look even in the daytime and there is little movement outside after darkness sets in.\\n\\nThe Jat community is in the majority in the village that has a population in excess of 12,000. Not surprisingly then, much of the existing gangs consist of Jats. “People from other communities try to keep away from crime. They wouldn’t survive in any case if they indulged in all this,” says Surajbhan Shastri, a 65-year-old resident of Mitraon.\\n\\nNon-natives and members of other castes agree. “I lower my gaze and travel between home and work. That is the only way to survive in this village,” says Prakash Anand, a native of Bihar who has been living in Mitraon for the past 10 years.\\n\\nVillage elders concede they were indifferent when it all began and say they should have done enough to quell the egos of the younger generation in time.\\n\\nThe elders, who claim to have little to do with the existing gang war, spend their time playing cards or smoking hookah at common points in the village. “The boys kill each other, but we elders try to keep our bonds intact. We attend weddings in each other’s families even as our sons are part of rival gangs,” says 65-year-old Shastri who claims no one from his family is into crime.\\n\\nBad reputation\\nBut the village’s image has taken a major hit even among some neighbouring villages.\\n“When we visit other villages, people ask us about the crime situation back home. People resist from marrying their girls to men in our village due to fear of early widowhood,” says Shastri.\\n\\nOne Mitraon villager looked around for two years before he could find a groom for his daughter.\\n\\nThe girl was a government school teacher, but the likely grooms' parents did not want to have any relations with a family of criminals, say villagers.\\n\\nUnable to exercise control over their children, more and more parents today in Mitraon village are sending their young children to boarding schools in other cities, if only that can keep them away from the crime world. “Staying jobless is a sure route to entry into some gang,” says Inder Singh.\\n\\nSome parents have even been taking control over the TV remotes.\\n“The boys liken the village gangsters to characters in Bollywood films in which orphans rise from the railway tracks to rule over the crime world. The boys then want to imitate gangsters whom they see arriving in the village in SUVs with armed bodyguards around them,” says Shastri.\",\n",
       "  \"The killing of former Najafgarh MLA Bharat Singh has once again highlighted how gangs are active in the lawless outskirts of the capital. Despite Delhi Police forming special units to tackle the menace, many notorious names have managed to evolve in the past 20 years.\\n\\nThese gangs fight for area supremacy and do not hesitate to eliminate anyone who comes in the way.\\n\\nSome of the new gangsters who have earned notoriety include Naveen Khati, Ravinder Bholu, Neeraj Bawana, Manoj Morkheri, Manjeet Mahal, Sandeep Mental and Vikas Langarpuria.\\nThey threaten businessmen for extortion, kidnap for ransom, deal in drugs, illegal arms and illicit liquor, and work under the garb of real estate business.\\n\\n“Over the last two decades, property prices in Delhi have skyrocketed. These gangs have taken full advantage of the boom and acquired disputed properties. Now the situation is such that no property in most parts of outer Delhi can change hands without their blessings,” says Rajiv Ranjan, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).\\n\\nThe gang members thus appear to be property dealers, but the majority of their fortune is through extortion and other illegal activities.\\n\\nIn some cases, they also provide protection to the landowners for a fee and a share in the development pie. However, when differences come up between such gangs, the end result is often deadly.\\n\\nThe villages of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi have been the most infamous for such gang wars. There, fight for land and supremacy has mainly been between two groups in the villages of Mitraon and Dichaon Kalan, about six kilometres apart.\\n\\nDichaon Kalan is the stronghold of Kishan Pehelwan, the elder brother of Bharat Singh. Mitraon is home to Pehelwan's rivals, members from the Anoop-Balraj gang.\\n\\nPolice have a dismal presence in these villages. Anoop and Balraj were brothers and their father Surat Kane was a known gangster during the early 1990s. Kane wanted a piece of land from Balwan Fauji, a landlord of the area.\\n\\nFauji had then hired Kishan Pehalwan to deal with the matter.\\nSince then, the two gangs have been involved in bloody gun battles on the streets of outer Delhi, killing dozens of men from both sides.\\n\\nPolice say the gangs also get hired on contract for settling land disputes.\\nWhile Kishan Pehalwan had an upper hand initially, his rivals gained ground gradually.\\n\\nAfter Balraj was killed by Kishan Pehalwan’s accomplices in 1998, Anoop took over the gang and tried to reach a compromise with the rivals. But it did not materialise. In September 1999, Anoop’s gang shot dead Kishan Pehalwan’s 22-year-old brother Kuldeep in central Delhi.\\n\\nOn the same day, Anoop's 19-year-old nephew Yash Pal was also killed outside his shop in Mitraon. In 2004, Anoop himself was  shot dead in Haryana’s Rohtak.\\n\\nAfter most of the members of the Anoop-Balraj gang were killed, Kishan Pehelwan entered politics and became a councillor. Bharat Singh became an MLA in 2008.\\n\\nAround this time, a number of other gangs formed in the outskirts of Delhi, including Bawana, Narela, Rohini, Alipur and Khanjawala.\\nOver the years, they have been trying to challenge Kishan Pehelwan’s gang.\\nCharred bodies\\n\\nFour men, whose charred bodies were found in a burnt car in Haryana on January 1, were also victims of revenge killing in gang war between Naveen Khati and Ravinder Bholu in Najafgarh. Manish, Sandeep, Sudhir and Deepak, residents of Mitraon village, were shot dead when they were returning home after New Year celebrations.\\n\\nThe bodies were then kept in a Toyota Etios car, which was taken to Haryana’s Jhajjar district and set on fire to destroy evidence. It was later revealed that they were members of Naveen Khati’s gang and were brutally killed by Ravinder Bholu’s gang in indiscriminate firing.\\n\\n“Ravinder’s gang had planned the killing to avenge the murder of Ravinder’s brother and the humiliation that Ravinder faced from Naveen while lodged at Tihar Jail. The gang planned to kill the youths when they passed near their office after a New Year party in Mitraon village,” Ranjan adds.\\n\\nGang wars tend to escalate after the death of a gang leader. A day after Neetu Dabodia was shot dead in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj last year, a war for supremacy began between Dabodia's rivals Neeraj Bawana and Manoj Morkheri. A shootout betweem them took place in Narela.\\n\\nAlthough both Bawana and Morkheri are in Tihar Jail, they still operate through their aides. Bawana, known as the extortion king, is a resident of Bawana village in outer Delhi. He was arrested in June 2012 following an extortion call to Najafgarh MLA Jaswant Rana. Bawana was earlier associated with Naveen Bali before forming his own gang. Morkheri, who is from Rohtak, was behind several kidnapping cases in the capital.\\n\\nTihar tales\\nOver the years, it has also become common practice for gang leaders to continue to run their business from inside the jail.\\n\\nRecently, three members of the Neeraj Bawana gang were arrested after police intercepted several mobile phones on a tip-off tip-off that regular contact was made with jailed leaders of the gang . Recently, the gang had demanded Rs 50 lakh from a Rohini-based businessman and threatened another businessman.\\n\\nPolice intercepted mobile phones linked with Naveen Bali, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. Naveen had contacted Lalit Mathur, a resident of Rohini Sector-18, in February to demand the money.\\n\\nThe phone calls also revealed that the gang was making threatening calls to Prahladpur-resident Anup Sahi to vacate a plot in outer Delhi's Shahbad Dairy area. Anup was being told to hand over the land documents to the gang.\\n\\nIn another expose of the weak security apparatus in Tihar Jail,  gangster Amit Shukla was found making extortion calls to businessmen and builders in Delhi and Mumbai from inside the jail last month. Shukla is an accused in the murder cases of television news producer Soumya Vishwanathan and BPO employee Jigisha Ghosh.\\n\\nThe intercepted calls were made by a SIM card bought with fake documents. In 2013, police had intercepted several hours of calls made by Shukla from inside the jail.\\n\\n“Following the reports, Tihar Jail authorities have ordered a study to check the effectiveness of the mobile jammers,” adds Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.\\n\\nAs many as 13 SIM cards were also used by Sharafat Sheikh from his high security cell in Tihar Jail. Sheikh has been booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, MCOCA and the NSA Act. He used to run an organised drug racket in Delhi between 1998 and 2005.\\n\\nThough such revelations have been shocking, they have also helped police to crack down on the gangs. Last year, one of the most wanted gangsters in the capital was killed in a police encounter.\\n\\nRajesh Bawana was wanted in cases of carjacking, abduction and extortion cases. An interesting oddity about him was that he used to identify himself, and even tell his victims to go to the police. “I am Rajesh Bawana from Kanjhawala. My father's name is Anoop Singh. Do inform police,” Rajesh used to tell them. His hideouts were busted following the interrogation of a jailed accomplice.\\n\\nSpecial Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) S N Shrivastava says Rajesh had spread terror among the capital's businessmen and aimed to take slain gangster Neetu Dabodia's place. “In view of his rise in the crime world and his crime graph, several police teams from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were hot on his trail,” Shrivastava says.\\n\\nBut, as police have failed to nab the killers of Bharat Singh, they are expecting further bloodshed in Najafgarh. It is suspected that Kishan Pehalwan's aides might try to eliminate men behind the killing.

       "  \"Veteran filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, who calls himself a facilitator of the cultural dialogue between India and Pakistan, says Bollywood is responsible for reviving the interest in cinema in the neighbouring country, where a play based on his 1989 film Daddy was recently staged.\\n\\nIn a tete-a-tete with IANS, the 66-year-old said that with the Pakistani film industry\\n“almost non-existent”, the popularity of Bollywood films and stars is what has\\nmotivated them to revive their own industry.\\n\\n“Pakistani people have Indian actors figuring in their lives like in India... when you walk on the streets of Karachi, you have advertisements of Priyanka Chopra or Shah Rukh Khan endorsing some product or the other adorning the walls there,” Bhatt said.\\n\\n“Their movie halls exhibit films starring Indian actors... because their own film industry is almost non-existent. Their film industry has been revived because of Bollywood offerings. They live with it... people there have got a new lease of life because of Bollywood,” the National Award-winner added.\\n\\nIndian movies were banned in Pakistan in 1968 and as a result the film industry across the border suffered recession. While the ban was eased in 2006, most theatres in the country couldn’t survive the self-imposed drought. In fact, just earlier this year, the 66-year-old Taj Mahal cinema in the country’s Abbottabad city was shut down due to lack of clientele. That said, there are filmmakers who have come up in recent times, and got noticed for their work. Be it Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, who won the first Oscar for her country with Saving Face, or names like Mehreen Jabbar (Ramchand Pakistani) and Shoaib Mansoor (Khuda Kay Liye) – their differentiated filmmaking has struck a chord with global audiences.\\n\\nIn India also, there is a hei\\xadghtened interest in Pakistani works ever since movies from the other side of the border have started releasing here. Then, there is also accessibility to TV content from Pakistan – courtesy Zindagi channel. Bhatt sampled Pakistan's love for Indian art and culture when he was there to present Daddy, which was staged at the International Theatre Film Festival 2015, organised by Karachi’s National Academy of Performing Arts. All three shows went houseful and “people really gave it\\na very powerful response”, he said.\\n\\n“I was personally happy that it touched a lot of hearts and people were very happy to have us amidst them but it was more triumph for the director (Danish Iqbal) and Imran (lead actor Imran Zahid). I went there since the material was sourced from my film and I am a facilitator in the cultural process between India and Pakistan,” he added.\",\n",
       "  'Kids glued to gadgets, be it a cell phone or tablet, are not a rare sight anymore. They operate these like a professional which is not surprising as they live in a world surrounded by gizmos.\\n\\nIn such a scenario, taking  kids away from gadgets is not an easy task.Dhiraj and Deeksha have twin boys  — Manet and Manyu. They say that their children were exposed to gadgets when they were just 18-months-old. “We started showing them picture cards of animals and fruits on the devices. Soon, they could locate the relevant Apps all by themselves. They then graduated to jigsaw puzzles and quiz Apps over a period of time,” says Dhiraj.\\n\\nBut he makes sure that he regulates the usage. “We have never bought our sons any exclusive gaming gadget to make sure the line is clearly drawn. Parents must set the rules because kids can derive equal joy from  playing outdoors and using gadgets,” he says.\\n\\nAmrita and Sharath believe that their children learn from example and therefore they have minimised the use of gadgets in front of their kids. “Today children are drawn to gadgets because they have no one to interact with at home. With the onset of nuclear families and parents busy at work or household chores, kids  get little or no time with their parents. This is why most children turn to gadgets. My husband and I try to encourage our children to spend most of their time outdoors. We give them a fixed time for usage of gadgets,” adds Amrita. \\n\\n Jose Thomas, a lawyer, has two children in their early teens. “We monitor the time they spend on these gadgets. Their cell phones are just basic models since we don’t believe in giving them high-end ones just yet. They should know what technology can do,” says Jose.\\n\\nBut Amrita begs to differ when she says that no gadget can keep the child as creatively occupied as much as friends, family and nature can. “I try to come up with creative ways to keep my children away from gadgets. During vacations, we try to arrange as many play dates with their friends and encourage them to spend time outdoors,” explains Amrita.\\n\\nWhat starts off as an exploration turns into an addiction of sorts if parents don’t pay enough attention to regulate the time spent on gadgets, say child psychologists. Dr Sugami Ramesh, senior consultant, Clinical Psychology, Apollo Hospitals thinks excess use of gadgets by children makes them insensitive to their surroundings.\\n\\n“We find that children who are hooked to gadgets don’t tend to listen to their parents. It’s good to know about technology but too much of it could unleash an adverse effect,” she states. She feels children must be encouraged to connect to people rather than to gadgets.',\n",
       "  'This photograph was taken in 1984 when the renowned Kannada poet, Prof KS Nisar Ahmed, was the president of  Karnataka Sahitya Academy. A felicitation function had been arranged for Masthi Venkatesha Iyengar, the  Kannada writer who had bagged the prestigious ‘Jnanapeetha Award’ for that year.\\n\\nIt was a memorable  function in which many prominent writers  had participated. After the function, some of the close friends of Nisar Ahmed, including myself, gathered to congratulate him on arranging the function in a fitting manner. It was then that this photograph was taken.\\n\\nNisar Ahmed had started writing poetry in Kannada when he was studying MSc in Geology at the Central College  in the fifties. His poetry had caught the attention of his teacher and Kannada scholar GP Rajarathnam. He happened to read and correct his poetry and got it printed in the magazine of the Kannada Sangha of Central College. Later, poetry became his forte and he brought out one poetry collection after another.\\n\\nHe wrote prose too and translated two of Shakespeare’s plays. But he is recognised as a poet mainly as he has been writing poetry through all the literary movements of Kannada.Though his mother tongue is not Kannada, he has been writing in Kannada only.\\n\\n    Nisar Ahmed had also told the literary critics that he does not need any concession just because his mother tongue is not Kannada. He is also known as ‘Nithyostava Poet because his lyrics appeared in the first cassette of modern Kannada poetry under the same title. Since then, Nisar Ahmed has been a household name as one of the most popular among contemporary Kannada poets.\\n\\nHe was the president of the Karnataka Sahitya Academy between 1984 and 1987 and launched several programmes to take literature to the common people. In order to encourage young writers, many workshops were organised and lectures by eminent writers were arranged. He also organised a literary programme in every district and taluk head quarters and involved the local writers and the people  in creating awareness about the current literary trends. He started the English edition of the Academy’s quarterly journal ‘Aniketana’.\\n\\nIt was devoted to the English translation of Kannada literary pieces. Thus, it enabled the non-Kannada readers also to get an understanding of Kannada literature through translations. I remember that he had organised a seminar as the president of the Academy in Kanakapura of Bangalore Rural District in 1986 on the last quarter century of modern Kannada poetry in which stalwarts of Kannada literary world including Prof M Gopala Krishna Adiga, Prof  LS Seshagiri Rao, Dr Ramachandra Sharma, Dr Kamala Hampana had participated.\\n\\nIn the evening, there was a poets’ meet under the chairmanship of poet Dr Pu Thi Narasimhachar. It is worth mentioning that the seminar was attended by the people of Kanakapura in large numbers and actively participated in the interaction with the speakers of the seminar.\\n\\n This photograph assumes importance for another reason. Two writers of yesteryears, namely the late Prof VM Inamdar and Prof Venugopala Soraba, are present in it.',\n",
       "  'Logan Schaedig and Hollis Coats believe that beer brewing is an art that not only requires loads of imagination and creativity but monumental patience as well. They began their career with Arbor Brewing Company in the United States. Logan Schaedig, the head brewer, was a part of the core team in the US until he moved to Bengaluru a couple of years ago to set up the Arbor Brewing Company here. \\n\\nIt’s the freedom to explore and experiment that Logan loves most about his job. He doesn’t believe that beer should be drunk in the typical flavour. He feels that it would taste much better if a lot more ingredients were added on. “Bengaluru has given us the opportunity to throw in the very local ingredients during the brewing process. We’ve tried making beer from raw mangoes, tomatoes, saffron, watermelon and chikoo. This not only enriches the flavour but adds to the pleasure of beer drinking,” reasons Logan.\\n\\n   Hollis too worked in the parent company in the US before joining Logan in Bengaluru. “We try not to stick to the predictable format of beer brewing. We’ve tried making beer with carrot, chocolate, coffee and herbs. It’s all healthy and changes the way you look at the very concept of beer drinking,” explains Hollis.\\n\\n Logan and Hollis not only spend a lot of time at work together but take time off to discover Bengaluru. “We’ve hopped in and out of every conceivable restaurant, pub and wayside eatery. We used to regularly gorge on the streetside ‘pani puri’ until I fell terribly ill. We stopped it at once after that,” explains Logan. The duo swear by the typical South Indian breakfast of ‘idli’, ‘dosa’ and ‘egg dosa.’ “There’s a tiny place closer to where we stay and we are almost regulars over there for the ‘dosa.’ It’s healthy and a perfect way start to the day,” reasons Hollis.\\n\\n  Logan and Hollis create a new flavour of beer everyday. “We revamp the menu at Arbor Brewing Company here regularly and have noticed that the people have taken well to the change. Even women don’t shy away from trying out the different flavours,” shares Logan.\\n\\n Work is demanding and challenging as well but Logan and Hollis never miss a chance to pack their bags and head out for a vacation across the country, only to return rejuvenated with newer ideas.',\n",

Sunny, in her upcoming film ‘Ek Paheli Leela’, has danced to the track’s new version, which retains the signature ‘Dholi Taro Dhol Baje’ tune.\\n\\n“I was really really nervous when I was told that this song would be there in the film. I still haven’t seen any review on what people think about the song so that is a little scary because hearing nothing is also not good. But I was definitely scared. I really hate that it was being compared to two of the biggest stars,” said Sunny.\\n\\nThe 33-year-old ‘Ragini MMS 2’ actress shared the number is her favourite track from the album.“When you are a newcomer in Bollywood, you look at these people and think they are so talented. And then someone wants to re-create it and even if the song is great, you will be compared and at some point, you will not measure up because they were so amazing,” she said.\\n\\nWhat got her more worried was that she saw the original Aishwarya, Salman Khan number before performing her own.“I watched the original before performing our version and that made it more scary. I hope when people see it, they say ‘Sunny did a decent job’.

A collector of keychains for over a decade now, her collection is vast and varied. Each one is testament to her travels and the different stories she has to share. She even fondly calls the collection the ‘Hanging Keychain Garden’!\\n\\nSabhyata started collecting keychains when she was doing her bachelors in engineering, way back in 2000.    “I used to live in Mysuru and was doing an engineering course in Mandya. I was fascinated by the sheer number of keychain vendors and the variety that they used to sell. This spurred me to collect keychains.” She hasn’t stopped since. \\u2008She has about 118 keychains in her collection – from bare metal ones to those that have unique shapes and intricate designs.\\n\\nHer collection includes keychains from metros like Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai, tourist spots like Goa and Kullu Manali, temple towns like Madurai and Udupi and from hole-in-the-wall shops around the City. She makes sure that she buys at least four keychains whenever she travels to a new place.  She has found star attractions for her collection outside temples such as Dodda Ganeshana Gudi in Basavanagudi and Muddu Udupi Sri Krishna  along with a metal keychain of Manjunatha from Dharmasthala, one of Radha and Krishna from ISKCON and another in the form of Hanuman Gade from the Doddanjaneya Temple in Mahalaxmi Layout.\\n\\nHer treasured assets also include keychains in the form of toys and handmade dolls bought from exhibitions.     At the Dasara exhibition, she had bought keychains with cloth dolls and jute boys. There are keychains with Channapatna toys picked up from ‘khadi’ exhibitions. She also has a keychain with two girls from the Kalakruthi exhibition.\\n\\nAlthough handmade keychains are the ones she treasures the most, she says, “I have many favourites. I have a beaded keychain which I bought from Akshardham in Delhi for Rs 80. It happens to be the costliest and one of my favourites. I also have a keychain which is in the form of a cycle made from unused wires.\\n\\n A few other pretty ones come from handloom exhibitions in Chickpet and Channapatna.” She also has ‘multipurpose keychains’ in her bouquet of collection.     They are in the form of torches, screw-drivers, Pepsi bottles with pens, nail-cutters, measuring tapes and a weighing instrument that she carries around with her.     Roadside vendors have also contributed to her collection with intelligently-shaped designs. From simple keychains in the form of gambling dices, cigarette-shaped ones, girls and money to gory ones like skeletons and fish-bones, her collection is unique. \\n\\nSabhyata says, “Designs of keychains have changed a lot ever since I started collecting. I used to have bare metal keychains. Soon, handmade, jute and wooden keychains were an intimate part of my collection. Now, the keychains of cartoons and caricatures are in vogue. My daughter keeps me updated on keychains from shows like ‘Chhota Bheem’, ‘Jaggu’, ‘Bal Hanuman’ and about Barbie dolls and ‘Angry Birds’.”\\n\\nShe adds that her daughter picks up keychains for her when she visits old shops. Her family, too, has generously contributed to her hobby. “My aunt gave me a keychain from a Nepal trip.” But she says she finds the best keychains during train journeys, especially the ones from Bengaluru to Mysuru. From Delhi,  she has bought at least six keychains.   She would like to pursue this hobby as collecting keychains comes in handy.\\n\\n  “It’s a cost-effective hobby. Keychains are reasonably priced with beautiful colours and patterns.” Although, many a time, her child has not received return gifts from tours, Sabhyata makes sure she brings back her treasured keychains, which fully clink of stories.',\n",
       "  'He had visited Bengaluru in the early 90s and when an opportunity to settle down here came knocking last year, Chef Armando Di Filippo welcomed it with open arms. The Chef de Cuisine - Italian of Movenpick Hotel & Spa Bangalore hails from Rome, Italy and his father was also a chef thanks to which, he picked up an interest for the culinary arts at a young age. The family had shifted to Montreal, Canada, due to his father’s work when he was a boy. “When we shifted back to Italy later, my father decided to open a restaurant and that’s how my culinary experience began,” he recalls. “Whenever I would get some time off studies, I would go to the restaurant and cook. It was a typical old restaurant that served rustic Italian food and had a fireplace in the centre. I learnt to make many basic things like fresh pasta and grilled meat over there,” he says.\\n\\nAfter finishing school, Armando started working in various pizzerias and bakeries and it was during this time that he met his wife, Barbara. He also recalls having visited Bengaluru back then. “We follow Sai Baba so I had come to work in the Puttaparthi canteen. Bengaluru was a calm city back then. The only happening places were MG\\u2008Road (without the Metro) and the airport,” he laughs.\\n\\nSo last year, when he got a job opportunity in the City, he was more than excited not only due to his earlier tryst with the City but also because his mother was also staying here. “I worked in Toscano for a few months. But I wanted to work in a hotel, so when I got the chance to work with Movenpick, I took it up,” he says. Soon, Barbara and his children — Noemi (13) and Lorenzo (11) — followed. “I enjoy new experiences and when this opportunity came along, I thought why not,” says Barbara.\\n\\nThe family likes to explore the\\u2008City in its free time. “We usually come to Brigade Road and Commercial Street,” says Armando to which Barbara adds, “I like going to the different malls like Orion Mall and shopping for branded clothes.”\\n\\nAccording to Armando, the cultures of India and Italy are very similar. “Like\\u2008Italians, Indians also like to stay with their family. Also, friendship is one of the most important relationships in Italy,” he says. The cuisines, with their gravies and vegetables, are similar too as he points out, “Seventy five per cent of our cuisine is also vegetarian. We use a lot of zucchini, broccoli, parsley and fresh lettuce in our meals. Italy is also famous for its tomatoes. We have around 40 types of tomatoes and the one you use for a sauce is different from the one that is used for pickles or salads. It’s basically like the variety of mangoes that you have over here.”\\n\\nIs the Italian cuisine available in Bengaluru authentic?\\u2008“Actually, we have only eaten at places that have an Italian chef.\\u2008So far, it has been authentic,”\\u2008he laughs. Barbara enjoys her share of Indian food. “I like ‘dosa’, ‘chicken biryani’, ‘mutton biryani’ and ‘chicken tandoori’. But I don’t like too much spice also,” she notes. Though she loves the sari, she hasn’t tried wearing one yet.\\u2008“I feel I may not be comfortable in it,” she laughs.\\n\\nDoes the traffic in the City bother them?\\u2008“Actually, it’s much lesser than that of Rome. Over there, it’s impossible to move, especially in the mornings.\\u2008Even the weather here is like spring always. It’s more extreme in Rome,” says Armando.\\n\\nThe couple feels Bengaluru is a “growing business City” and that’s why it’s a great place for their children, who study in Orchids – The International School. Thirteen-year-old Noemi loves her school and friends. “I have many friends and a lot of them are Indians,” she says.\\u2008On being asked what she likes to do in her free time, she says, “I\\u2008like drawing and dancing. I even studied classical ballet for nine years and am presently looking for a teacher here.” Happy with their stay in the City, Barbara sums up their experience saying, “I\\u2008hope we stay here for many more years to come.”',\n",
       "  'One Girl Shy’ – as quirky as their name is their music. It is fresh, experimental and vibrant. The band comprises Akhilesh Kumar as the lead vocalist, guitarist and composer, Archana Iyer on vocals, Kerrie Smith on drums, Kevin Vineeth Kumar on bass guitar, Megha Shankar on vocals and Shravan Sridhar on violin.\\n\\nThe band was the brainchild of Akhilesh, who brought the artistes together. It so happened that Akhilesh was trying out some riffs on his guitar at a studio with the producer of the band. Both of them liked the riff and decided that they needed more artistes on board. What is unique about the band is that they do not stick to the same line up. The artistes vary for different songs based on the requirement of the composition. This ensures that the band remains inquisitive and experimental.\\n\\nThey get their name from one of the girls in the band who was apparently very shy that she would try to sneak off stage while performing. Another reason for the name is because the female members of the band have brought in strong elements to it – they are actually responsible for changing the sounds of the group. Although they don’t stick to the line up, they make it a point to have one female musician at all times.\\n\\n‘One Girl Shy’ falls under the banner of alternative folk rock but the band members feel that the genre does not affect the spectrum of music that they wish to play. “The last thing we would want is to be labeled and not be able to write a song because it doesn’t fit our genre. We prefer to write feel-based music which is simple and connects with the people. We are rock genre with folk roots, that is what we would like to be known,” says Akhilesh.\\n\\nThe idea of playing with different sounds is influenced by various factors like nature, travel and day-to-day experiences. A song that the band is working on currently is inspired by Akhilesh’s recent trip to Andaman and the experience he had during his visit.\\n\\nThe members are quite excited about their upcoming debut album which they plan to start recording early next month. Until then the band hopes to play as many shows as possible to promote their music and get some funding for the album, which includes a song called ‘Hopscotch Man’, already a success with the audience.\\n\\nThe songs deal with breaking the standard rules and creating their own which are far more meaningful. One of the songs talk about how a person, when he was working, realises there is much more than just a job. He then sets himself free by breaking out of the shell.\\n\\nMost of the songs talk about breaking a monotonous routine and indulging in something that is innovative and creative.\\nMost of the band members have day-time jobs so meeting and jamming together is the most challenging aspect for them. Jamming session are divided in two phases. “There are generally two jams that take place. Morning jamming is reserved for vocals and the evening is for instrumental jams. Weekends are usually where both the elements are brought together,” says a band member. What unites the band members is just one thing – music!',\n",

       "  'Nandi is a symbol of eternal waiting. He is in waiting, but he is not waiting for Shiva to come and say something. He is in waiting because waiting is considered the greatest virtue in Indian culture. He will wait forever. One who knows how to simply sit and wait is naturally meditative. That quality is the essence of receptivity.\\nNandi is Shiva’s closest accomplice because he is the essence of receptivity. Before you go into a temple, you must have the quality of Nandi – to simply sit. You are not trying to go to heaven, you are not trying to get this or that – you go inside and simply sit.\\n\\nSo, just by sitting here, he is telling you, “When you go in, don’t do your fanciful things. Don’t ask for this or that. Just go and sit like me.” People have always misunderstood meditation as some kind of activity. No, it is a quality. That is a fundamental difference. Prayer means you are trying to talk to God.\\n\\nYou are trying to tell him your vows, your expectations, or whatever else.\\nMeditation means you are willing to just listen to existence, to the ultimate nature of creation.\\n\\nYou have nothing to say, you simply listen. That is the quality of Nandi – he just sits, alert.\\nThis is very important: he is alert. He is not sleepy or sitting in a passive way.\\n\\nHe is sitting very active, full of alertness and life, but no expectation or anticipation. That is meditation. Just waiting, not for anything in particular.\\n\\nIf you just wait without doing your own thing, the existence will do its thing.\\nMeditation essentially means the individual person is not doing his own thing. He is just there.\\n\\nOnce you are simply there, you become aware of the larger dimension of the existence, which is always in action. You become aware that you are a part of it. Even now, you are a part of it. But becoming aware that “I am a part of it” is meditativeness.\\n\\nNandi is the symbolism of that.

       "  'Richness is connected with life. A person is born without bringing wealth and leaves the world once he dies without taking anything — what he has acquired during his lifetime. There are different perceptions of richness and wealth by different segments of society. What is richness to children and what is richness to adults or to haves and have nots?\\n\\nFor a child, it is not only the comfort and it is mother’s emotional shelter, what is palatable is richness.  If you give a child when it asks, say a toffee, a chocolate of just Rs 2 or Rs 5, she is happy and feels rich. When he goes to play-home and nursery, it is the food she eats away from mother’s care.  You ask a kindergarten child after she returns from play- home, “What did you do, in the school?” She says, “I had food”.\\n\\nThe child when it goes at to play with other children, when it has a fall, she comes back crying to the mother.  “Mummy, I fell down!” What does the mother do? She asks, “Child, where are you hurt?”  She shows the place which is hurting.  Mother blows a few breaths on to the spot and the child goes back running happily to play.  Was it money?  No, the mother’s emotional touch which healed the child’s injury.  This is richness of humanity.\\n\\nConsider the poor labourer.  His richness is that he should get three square meals, clothes to cover himself and a comfortable place to sleep. It is only the middle class and the high end society that they want money, wealth, comforts and what not. Who is rich? One who has lot of money, one who has abundant money? Can anybody specify the quantum?  The more one has, the more he wants to acquire or is one rich who has earned lots of money or the one who can spend lots of money?  Or is it the one who says I do not want any more, I have enough. May be you can say, he is rich.\\n\\nIrrespective of all the facts, most of the people live on the periphery of tinsel town and many want to get into the comforts and wealth of tinsel town by committing a crime.  Crime could be of any kind. The one who gets hungry and can eat well, one who can get good sleep is a rich person. Because, there are many people in the world, who don’t have appetite or who cant enjoy good food because of medical reasons.  There are many who don’t get sleep, despite resorting to pills.\\n\\nThe person who has a sound mind and sound body is the richest person, because all the wealth in the world cannot buy good health. A person who does not take medicine for anything is the wealthiest person. A house without medicines is the riches home. In other words, it is the happiness, as money can not buy happiness. Once my General Officer Commanding went to a seer and said “Reverend Guruji, I want happiness”. The seer said “remove ‘I’, remove ‘want’ and you will have happiness”',\n",
       "  'The Union health ministry’s decision to defer the increase in the size of warning advertisements on tobacco packets is wrong and ill-motivated. It is wrong because there was no convincing reason to put on hold a decision which was taken after careful consideration. It is ill-motivated because public policy has been undermined by private interests on the basis of a patently wrong claim. There seems to be some rethinking now after a controversy erupted and the prime minister intervened in the matter.  But the ministry is yet to reverse the decision which it took on the basis of an interim report of the Lok Sabha committee on subordinate legislation. The committee’s views on the matter do not bear scrutiny.  Its chairman and BJP MP, Dilip Gandhi, made the fantastic claim that the effect of tobacco products on Indians has not been studied because all the research in this area has taken place abroad.\\n\\n The claim is ridiculous because the impact of tobacco on the health of Indians could not be different from that on people of other countries.  There are any number of studies which show the dangerous consequences of the consumption of tobacco. India has the highest prevalence of oral cancer in the world.  It is a strange coincidence that Sunita Tomar, who had become the face of India’s anti-tobacco campaign, died after expressing dismay, in a letter to the prime minister,  over Gandhi’s remarks. The entire scientific and medical community has rubbished Gandhi’s claim. The argument of livelihood loss is also not tenable, in the light of the economic cost of the use of tobacco in India, estimated by the WHO, as Rs 1.04 lakh crore in 2011.\\n\\nAttention should have been paid to the greater public good involved in the reduction in the use of tobacco. The composition of the parliamentary committee is itself a give-away.  It has as a member an MP, who is considered the bidi king of India and who has claimed that tobacco is not only not harmful but has medicinal properties. It seems this situation of conflict of interest is being addressed now. Some countries like Australia have increased the size of pictorial warnings on tobacco product covers to 90 per cent. Studies have shown that this has helped to reduce tobacco consumption. The government should not succumb to the lobbying and pressure of the tobacco industry which has in the past even influenced the choice and tenure of ministers. It should enforce its earlier decision at the earliest.',\n",
       "  \"Allan Donald looked relaxed while keeping a close eye on Royal Challengers Bangalore bowlers at the nets. The South African pace legend seemed to have put behind another semifinal disappointment in the World Cup, and, if anything, was pleased to see the balance and talent in RCB’s bowling line-up this year.\\n\\nIn his second season as RCB’s bowling coach, Donald on Saturday spoke to the media about the team’s preparations ahead of the eighth edition of the IPL, and injury concerns to some of their bowlers among other things. Excerpts:\\n\\nHave you switched off from an emotionally draining World Cup?\\n\\nIt was a dark day at Auckland. We came so close to winning the World Cup. But it's been five days at home.\\n\\nIt's really nice to return home from a stressful tournament like that and see your wife and kids smiling at you. So it's not the end of the world for South Africa.\\n\\nWe move on and now we are into a new challenge that is another six more stressful weeks lying ahead.  \\n\\nBack to IPL, are you happy with the set of bowlers RCB\\u2008have for this season?\\n\\nI think the biggest headache is going to be picking the right (bowling) combination. Mitchel Starc and Adam Milne had a great World Cup. The presence of Sean Abbott, David Wiese gives us great balance. I think it's the first time we have guys of some real pace with speed above 145 and 150km/h. Starc is unfortunately missing out for three weeks with a dodgy knee. And obviously we have a young Indian back up...Varun Aaron has had a relatively good tour of Australia and then there is Sandeep Warrier. I think we have nice guys to choose from and I am really happy.\\n\\nI followed especially Sandeep in the domestic competition. Yuzvendra Chahal has done extremely well, and Ashok Dinda does what Ashok Dinda does. He always brings something new to the table and keep his end going. I have followed their first-class careers and it's nice to catch up with them.\\n\\nUpdate us on the fitness of Starc and Milne...\\n\\nI think Starc will probably miss two to three games in this IPL and he will be coming over. It’s a bit of a big loss for us. Milne was also struggling with a bruised heel, but he is very close to be back bowling again. But that's an opportunity for other guys to step up.\\n\\nStarc was in great form and obviously we would have liked to have him in the first game against KKR.\\n\\nAaron has extreme pace, but he has the tendency to give away runs. How do you plan to bridge that gap?\\n\\nWhen you look at guys like that — your Brett Lee's, (Mitchell) Johnson's, these guys always go for a few runs but it's their aggressive nature, their attacking nature that they bring to the game. They are always hunting for wickets so pace brings a bit of looseness but it also brings wickets. So, you won't change that attitude. I've been in the same position before.\\n\\nMay be we have to narrow down the channels a little bit. We don't want to take away that aggressive nature from Varun.\\n\\nI like his attitude and I think he is coming on well. Hopefully, it’s going to be a great IPL for him.\\n\\nHow do you ensure that pace bowlers channelise the aggression in a right way?\\n\\nThis form of the game allows you to bring out the best attacking option. There is no other way of setting it up. You need to be aggressive and always hunting for wickets. They will always be given license to attack so what we have done is that I asked for feedback on last year’s patterns of play where we can step it up this year in terms of our pace. We need to be extensively attacking. So, Varun is part of that right through.\\n\\nIs it difficult to keep bowlers’ fresh as many of them are coming from World Cup and other domestic competitions?\\n\\nIf you see the work loads, the physios and trainers are always watching the bowlers’ work loads. It’s not like these players are coming in now and they have not played any cricket. The top guys, it is good that they are coming in after playing cricket and the physio and I are monitoring their workload at practice, so that they stay fresh for the duration of the tournament.\",\n",
       "  'Kings XI Punjab have had a bumpy ride during the past few years of Indian Premier League (IPL). But in the previous edition they turned the corner, reaching the final. Expectedly, the franchise has retained most of the players in their quest for a maiden trophy this season.\\n\\nThe three new purchases for the Kings XI this year are Murali Vijay, Nikhil Naik and Yogesh Golwalker. The team benefited from the appointment of Sanjay Bangar as head coach after Darren Lehmann took over the reins of Australia last year. Bangar’s partnership with captain George Bailey proved to be rewarding and took the side to their first final, where they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. Before that Kings XI could make it to the knockout stage only once when they reached the semifinals in 2008.\\n\\nOne of the significant reasons of the rise of the Mohali-based outfit in 2014 was the stellar performances by its new signings. The franchise lost Adam Gilchrist to retirement but made significant purchases in Bailey, Virender Sehwag, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, Laxmipathy Balaji, to bolster the squad. Only six players were retained from 2013, including David Miller and Manan Vohra.\\n\\nThe team’s strength lies in its explosive batting line-up. Sehwag can tear apart any attack on his day and the owners have got Vijay with the mind to ensure a solid opening pair. If the openers falter, Kings XI have swashbucklers in Maxwell, Bailey and Miller who with their inventive stroke-making can turn the complexion of a match from any situation. Even Wriddhiman Saha came on his own at No 3 last year thus rounding off a dangerous batting line-up.  Their bowling, however, centres around Johnson. But he had been well complimented last year by Sandeep Sharma and Balaji, not to forget young left-arm spinner Axar Patel, whose 17 wickets at an economy rate of 6.13 for Kings XI last year earned him a national call up for the tour of  Bangladesh.\\n\\nAhead of the new season, the squad has organised a camp at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) International Stadium in Pune. Bangar spoke about the hunger of the side to continue with their winning momentum. “Last year was a good season for us and we would want to carry on the winning spree this season as well. We have a well balanced team,” Bangar said.\\n\\nThe squad\\n\\nIndian players: Manan Vohra, Virender Sehwag, Rishi Dhawan, Sandeep Sharma, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Shivam Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Parvinder Awana, Anureet Singh, Karanveer Singh, Murali Vijay, Nikhil Naik, Yogesh Golwalkar\\n\\nForeign players: George Bailey (captain), David Miller, Mitchell Johnson, Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Thissara Perera, Beuran Hendricks.',\n",

       "  ' Indian pace bowlers were written off after modest efforts after the Test series against Australia and in the following tri-series. But the quicks -- Umesh Yadav, Mohammad Shami and Mohit Sharma -- emerged one of the best bowling units of the World Cup, picking up 48 wickets among them.\\n\\nIndia’s bowling coach Bharat Arun was least surprised by the turnaround, and rated it as on expected lines. “We didn’t have a bad Test series (against Australia) as people think. We could have won the first Test. We had our chances in the second Test too. We made a 400-plus score, and they were 240 for six but just that we could not go all the way. In Test series, every bowler bowled well in patches. In the tri-series actually our bowlers did pretty well. Australia were sailing at 200 for two, and we got a some quick wickets, but in the last over they went past the line with six wickets down,” began Arun.\\n\\n“Against England, we were all out for 200 and then reduced them to 60 for five. So, it’s wrong to say our bowlers were a failure in Australia. We always had belief in this set of bowlers. We wanted them to bowl as a pack, complement each other. We had a lot of centre wicket practice sessions, and simulations before the World\\u2008Cup. Then we analysed the lengths they went for runs and also the lengths that made it difficult for batsmen to score runs off them.\\n\\nOnce we had a chat with bowlers, they were pretty sure about the lengths they needed to bowl. There were also a lot of interactions between the batsmen and the bowlers as what length they were finding it tough to score runs, so that also helped them. To be honest, I wasn’t surprised to see our bowlers doing well in the WC. But it was a challenge for me to get the bowlers to bowl as a team,” he said.\\n\\n Arun stressed on the need to preserve this set of Indian pacers. “We always talk about the West Indian pace quartet of the 80s. But now India have a quartet of pace bowlers who can consistently bowl over 140 kmph. If you look at Umesh (Yadav), (Mohammad) Shami, Ishant (Sharma), Varun (Aaron) and Mohit (Sharma), we have five bowlers who can clock 140 kmph consistently, something very similar to the West Indians. It augurs extremely well for us and we need to encourage and preserve them. Then there are also some new bowlers coming up, trying to emulate the Pool A. We have a healthy stock of fast bowlers now, and we need to maintain it for a long time.”\\n\\nThe former Indian pacer also said the Indians need to work on accuracy, particularly Aaron, who will be Arun’s ward at Royal Challengers Bangalore during the IPL. “I don’t mind if a bowler gets wickets and then goes for some runs. Varun is not only one of the fastest bowlers in the country but in the world as well. If you look at it, two Indians were the fastest bowlers during India’s series against Australia. It was a very heartening sight to see. With that kind of pace, if he can work on a bit on accuracy, then\\u2008I think Varun could be an exciting prospect.”',\n",

But I think spinners still have a key role to play, they have a lot to give. I think modern day cricket makes spinners more perfect than what it was before,” Tahir told reporters during an open media session of Delhi Daredevils on Sunday.\\n\\n“The batsmen attack you more in T20, so maybe you have your chances.

The World Cup had seen him come of age, becoming the second-highest wicket-taker for South Africa with 15 wickets.\\n\\nHe was confident of carrying the same form to IPL, too. “If you back yourself, you will do well.”\\n\\nTahir insists that classical spin bowling is still alive but says the current era demands innovation, especially in a country like India. “Cricket has changed. So even in Test cricket, I think you can\\'t be a classical spinner you were 20 years ago. Your pace needs to vary in all formats. For me this is harder than classical spin bowling,” he said.\\n\\n“If you don\\'t have variations you can’t survive especially in India where guys are so good against spin.\"\\n\\nTougher format\\n\\nHis South African teammate, wicket-keeper and batsman Quinton De Kock finds 50-over cricket harder than T20 format.\\n\\n“The shortest format suits the batsmen more and therefore one doesn\\'t need to adjust too much while changing from 50 to 20-over format. In 50-over format, you need patience. T20 is nice little change for us, more for the batsman than bowlers,” said De Kock who was part of Daredevils’ miserable run last season.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old admitted that it took him a couple of days to swallow their World Cup exit in the semifinals but said he was now focused on doing his best for his IPL franchise. “World cup is past. I am focusing on IPL now. Last year we did not do too well. This year we got nothing to lose, so we can just go out there, give our best shot and see where it takes us,” he said.',\n",

But in the next four editions, they grabbed the title two times (2012, 2014), besides finishing runners-up in the Champions League T20 last year. Miracle. Hard work. Team effort. Call it anything you want, but their run has been fascinating and only the bionic Chennai Super Kings have more success in those two events combined.\\n\\nMay be it has something to do with the appointment of Gautam Gambhir as the skipper. The little Delhi man is a grim fighter, and he made fight a culture in the Kolkata team. He also ensured that the Knight Riders would retain their key players like Robin Uthappa, Sunil Narine and Manish Pandey and that continuity has played a big role in the team putting up consistent performances. They have not even let go Yusuf Pathan, who has not delivered with the bat as expected, and the players would naturally be eager to perform once the management places so much faith in them.\\n\\nThere was a cloud of doubt over the availability of Narine after the BCCI\\u2008banned him for a suspect bowling action during last year’s Champions League. But now that he has been allowed to bowl in this IPL, it will only bolster their attack. But by no means, it is a one-man army.

       "  ' Less than ten percent of the schools in the country have complied with the Right to Education Act. The cut in the budgetary allocations to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has added to the poor implementation of the law, according to a study conducted by the RTE\\u2008National Forum.\\n\\nMarking five years of implementation of the RTE Act, a draft report titled ‘Status of implementation of the RTE Act 2009: Year Five’ was released by the RTE National Forum last week. Recommendations based on the study report were submitted to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 26. More than 10,000 grassroot organisations including the Unicef and Unesco are part of this forum. According to the draft report,  a sum of Rs 14,115.43 crore is required for filling the infrastructure gaps in schools. As many as 35,96,311 teaches are yet to be provided with in-service training. This itself requires an additional allocation of Rs 3,596.31 crore.\\n\\nThe SSA was allotted Rs 26,801.01 crore in 2013-14 which has come down to Rs 22,000 crore in 2015-16.\\n\\nFunds apart, the report observes that the monitoring bodies such as State Child\\u2008Protection Commissions have not been performing their duties effectively so as to ensure successful implementation of the Act. As a result, students and parents do not have platforms to seek redressal of their grievances. In 2010-11, about 15 states had the state child protection commissions and 1,177 cases came up before these panels. In 2013-14, as many as 21 states formed the commissions, but the number of cases registered came down to only 174.\\n\\nBesides, 484 cases remain unresolved since 2010-11, the report stated, pointing at the passive role of child rights monitoring bodies.\\n\\nPoor teacher-student ratio, lack of infrastructure in schools and shortage of well-trained teachers are among the other major factors that the draft report has taken note of, in recommending remedial measures for strengthening primary education.\\n\\nAmong its several recommendations, the report urges government to reflect upon the effectiveness of the central Teacher Eligibility Test (TET). The government makes teacher recruitment based on this entrance test. “The TET system needs to be understood to check if it is the best method to identify qualified teachers,” the report states. It also calls for strengthening public education system and warns the government of a flawed approach in filling vacancies through hiring teachers on contract basis.\\n\\n“We have submitted memorandum to Narendra Modin on March 26 seeking him to convene a meeting of all chief ministers and education ministers. This task has to be taken up on a war-foot basis” said Ambarish Rai, national co- ordinator for the RTE Forum.',\n",

Cycling barefoot, he won the contest.\\n\\n“I remember my first achievement well, as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru passed away on the same day,” said D’Souza, who later went on to win championships at the district, state and even national levels.\\n\\nIn 1974, he won the State-level cycling championship and covered a distance of 44 miles in just two hours, 10 minutes and 25 seconds. “The nearest competitor was five miles behind me when I crossed the finish line,” he recalled, adding that he used his ordinary bicycle for the contests.\\n\\nNorbert was also the Mumbai-Khandala (Pune) cycling champion for three consecutive years in the ’70s. However, in 1970, he finished third in the national-level championship in\\u2008Haryana, as almost all the other contestants rode gear bicycles, while Norbert tried to keep up in his ordinary bicycle. He also missed a chance in the Asian Games in 1974 as he did not have a bicycle of his own to participate in the coaching camp in\\u2008Haryana.\\n\\nHis greatest achievement is when he covered 5,000 km – from Mangaluru to Delhi and back – in just 11 days and one hour, in 1977. The previous record was held by a German who had taken 12 days and two hours to cover 5,000 km.\\n\\n“The rally was organised by Fieldstar Company (a cycle manufacturing company) and a jeep followed me till Delhi and back,” he said. Even those in the jeep found it difficult to drive behind him as he rode for 16 to 18 hours or more in a day, he said. His passion for cycling came to an abrupt end when he met with an accident in 1977 that left him with multiple fractures. He then continued a profession in tailoring and even worked in Chicago (US) for two years as a tailor between 1990 and 1992. Though he was growing old, his passion for cycling burned within. Recalling his early life, he told Deccan Herald that there were days when there was nothing to eat at home.\\n\\nHis dream to own the best bicycles was realised when he bought two in May 2010. One was the US-made Trek Madone 5.2 racing cycle which cost him Rs 2.3 lakh, along with additional costs, including the mechanic’s travel cost who flew to Mangaluru from Mumbai just to assemble it. The bicycle made of carbon fibre weighs just six kg. The second cycle is also by Trek, but made in China, for which he paid Rs 1.5 lakh.\\n\\nA second shock shattered D’Souza when he suffered a stroke on June 18, 2011, a year after he bought the bicycles. Now, D’Souza plans to donate both his bicycles (with all the additional kits), valued at over Rs 4.5 lakh.  His only condition being “the person should be a promising cyclist from a poor background, who can’t afford to buy such bicycles.”',\n",

We want to create a body of experts to be able to handle the high number of patients,” Dr Satishchandra said.\\n\\nNeuropathology, practitioners say, studies the disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole autopsies.\\n\\n“Neuropathologists around the world have made important clinical and research contributions towards understanding of diseases that specifically affect the brain - degenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain tumors, trauma and neuromuscular diseases. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy of nervous tissue is taken and sent to the neuropathologist, who examines it using a microscope or certain molecular methods to make a definitive diagnosis,” says a neuro specialist.\\n\\nPractitioners point out that the work of the neuropathologist is largely about examining biopsy tissue from the brain and spinal cord to aid in diagnosis of disease.\\n\\n“The biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by radiologic imaging. As for autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various forms of dementia and other conditions that affect the central nervous system. In the day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist is a consultant for other physicians,” a specialist says.\\n\\nDr Satishchandra says that the country having just one centre is not good: “There is so much demand, but where are the specialists? Is it possible to go far and get treatment, which has to be at hand?\\n\\n“Since we do know that there is a need for multiple treatment centres across the country, we have felt there needs to be an institutional response to this and that’s why Nimhans has taken the initiative.”\\n\\nThe Nimhans director said addiction medicine would be “focussed on eliminating addiction to tobacco, alcohol or even to technology.” Addiction medicine is a medical specialty that deals with the treatment of addiction. The specialty often crosses over into other areas such as public health, psychology, social work, mental health counseling, psychiatry, and internal medicine, among others.\\n\\nLong-term therapies\\n\\nThe specialty looks into the processes of detoxification, rehabilitation, harm reduction, abstinence-based treatment, individual and group therapies, oversight of halfway houses, treatment of withdrawal-related symptoms, acute intervention, and long-term therapies designed to reduce likelihood of relapse. Some specialists, primarily those who also have expertise in family medicine or internal medicine, also provide treatment for disease commonly associated with substance use, such as hepatitis and HIV infection. Nimhans is expecting a good response to both the specialisations over the next three years.',\n",
       "  'Believed to be one of the most ancient religious beliefs of coastal Karnataka, Bhoota Kola holds mirror to the customs and practices of the Tuluvas. This annual ritual of spirit worship is practised with much fervour in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts in Karnataka. A night-long event, Bhoota Kola is marked with ornate costumes, make-up, music, dance, dialogues and, most of all, by the piety of those participating in this ancient form of spirit worship.\\n\\nTiny hamlet Nediyur, near Udupi, came alive. And what a spectacle it was! Spread over three nights, it was definitely worth every minute of its performance.Bhoota Kola lies at the core of the village life in this region, where spirits are worshipped for generations. It starts after dusk and continues until the wee hours and people gather in large numbers to witness the performances. There is a general feeling that the bhootas protect the villagers and livestock from evil forces.  \\n\\n These bhootas, believed to be the attendants of Lord Shiva, are considered as the conscience keepers of the community. The places where the bhootas are housed are called as bhootasthanas. The beliefs woven around this ancient form of practice are very interesting. For instance, there are different kinds of bhootas, each claiming descent from a particular god, goddess or gana. Vishnumurthi, Ermeru, Jataadhari, Vaidyanatha, Jumadi, Brahmer, Chaundi, Siri, Panjurli, Pilichamundi, Virabhadra and Guliga are some of the bhootas that are revered. Bhootas like Kalkuda-Kallurti, Jarandaya, Kodamandaya and Babbarya are considered to be the spirits of cultural personalities.\\n\\n Each bhoota is said to have a fixed sphere of influence, and is hence associated with certain families or villages. During the kola ceremony, the bhoota impersonator invokes the host family’s guar\\xaddian bhoota, and answers people’s queries. Bhoota Kola season starts from November (Diwali) and goes on until the last week of May. This much awaited event draws people from far and near, who bring along with them not only just their doubts and fears, but also offerings in different forms. People use this occasion to request the supernatural for a certain favour or thank for the blessings received.\\n\\nThe ceremonies are held in a well-decorated pandal, embellished with palm leaf and mango leaf festoons. A colourful rangoli adorns the place. The kola begins with the host ceremoniously offering coconut oil to the medium of spirit for a ritual bath. This is followed by the medium of spirit, also called patri, donning the make-up using pastes from plant extracts.Different costumes are used to symbolise the characteristic features of the bhootas, thus making each bhoota unique in its appearance. Even as the medium of spirit is engrossed in the facial make-up, female members of his family sing the pardanas (ballads) that narrate the story of the bhoota to be invoked, its heroic deeds and its sphere of influence.\\n\\nNarrated in a sing-song manner in Tulu, the tunes of these pardanas are quite catchy. This prepares the medium of spirit to identify himself with the particular spirit and sets the mood of the audience for the actions that follow. At the other end of the pandal are\\nother members of his family working with palm leaves to prepare his gown. The medium of spirit first tries on the dress, and then wears the requisite ornaments, including ear and shoulder coverings, a waist piece, bangles, anklets and the headgear.\\n\\nThe most important ornament of all is the gaggara (metal anklet), which gives a deep metallic sound. Even as he wears the gaggara, a small group of musicians start playing drums and wind instruments and the ritual dancer starts tapping his feet to the rhythm of the beats and invokes the spirit. Possession, trance and the dialogue of the medium of spirit with the devotees are the crucial stages of bhoota worship.Once he is possessed by the spirit, he jumps around, roaring with anger, and is offered tender coconuts to calm down.\\n\\nAfter downing several tender coconuts, the spirit addresses the host, wanting to know the reason behind his invocation. People pour out their woes at this juncture. He assumes the role of the spirit, listens to them patiently, and gives out suitable answers. Apart from according physical health and mental peace, the medium of spirit assumes the role of a tribunal and settles disputes, upholding truth and righteousness.\\n\\nAfter feasting on the offerings made to him, the appeased spirit once again assures the gathering of continued protection. He then sits down exhausted after a spirited performance spanning several hours and fans himself with a chamara (hand-held fan).\\nPeople take the cue and go up to the bhoota who blesses each one of them with a touch of his sword and hands out kumkum and pingara (arecanut flower), which people take home as prasada.\\n\\nIt was just one chapter of Bhoota Kola as several spirits, sometimes as many as 18, are invoked in a span of just two nights. However, if you thought Bhoota Kola was only about serious worship, then you’re mistaken. For, each moment of the performance is nothing like the one you would have seen before. Moreover, there are many light moments too, when some bhootas are accompanied by sidekicks, who double up as clowns, dancing vigorously, moving comically and cracking jokes to no end.',\n",

       "  'Confusion prevails over banning two-stroke engine autorickshaws in the City even as the fate of more than 30,000 of these vehicles and their drivers hangs in balance.\\n\\nWhile the government is mulling over banning the two-stroke engine autorickshaws completely in the City, efforts in the past by the Transport department to rein in these polluting vehicles have not resulted in much success.\\n\\nAbout two and a half years ago, the Transport department had made it clear that these two-stroke engine autorickshaws emit lot of smoke. Hence, it was made mandatory for all new autorickshaws to run on LPG\\u2008and have a four-stroke engine, to bring down emission levels and to phase out the two-stroke engine autos simultaneously.\\n\\nTo facilitate the switch to four-stroke engine vehicles, the department offers a subsidy of Rs 30,000. Yet, these autorickshaws continue to ply on the roads.\\n\\n1.1 lakh autorickshaws\\nAs per estimates, there are about 1.1 lakh autorickshaws in the City, of which 25,000-30,000 are illegally operating without valid documents and are running on mixed fuel such as diesel, kerosene or two-stroke engines, causing maximum pollution.\\n\\nAutorickshaw unions said that while they support the government’s move to ban these autorickshaws, they want the subsidy amount to be increased to Rs 50,000.\\nMany efforts made Manjunath, president of the Adarsh Auto Drivers Union, said, “In the past, the department had made many efforts to phase out these polluting autorickshaws and many of the drivers had voluntarily replaced their two-stroke engine autos with four-stroke engine autos.\\n\\n“But if these are banned, many will lose their livelihood. We welcome the government’s move, but the subsidy amount should be hiked to Rs 50,000”.\\nThis apart, lack of space for parking the seized autorickshaws is one of the main reasons why discarding them has not been possible. The enforcement teams of the Transport department had to discontinue their drive against illegal and polluting autos, as they were not left with any space to park them.\\n\\nOfficials said that even if the autos are violating norms such as having proper documents and running on four-stroke engines, they had to let them off with a penalty due to space constraints.\\n\\nWhile the norms laid down by the RTOs clearly say that the autorickshaws have to get a fitness certificate once in a year from the respective Regional Transport Office, which includes a pollution test, the illegally plying autos skip it conveniently or even better do not follow the regime due to weak enforcement.\\n\\nThe ‘Bangalore City Saptavarna Suraksha Sugama Sanchara’ scheme, a joint effort by the Traffic police and the Transport department, was launched to identify autos plying illegally, by providing an alphanumeric code and special-coloured plate to autos with valid documents and permit.',\n",

       "  'Builders in Bengaluru are poised to take forward the green building concept. A target of 300 buildings a year is part of the vision of Bengaluru’s builders who are members of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), a body that wants to increase the green footprint in the city.\\n\\nAs of now, green buildings form just one per cent of the total number of new constructions over the last five to 10 years, although Suresh Hari, Secretary Credai says that the green concept within Credai is higher than among builders outside Credai.\\n\\nThe concept of green living has been known for almost a decade. While many government and office buildings have gone green, the residential landscape in the City is not green enough to generate hi-tech green certifications.\\n\\nThe number of exclusive green apartments and residences are few, while the hype is high. The hope however is that green apartments or buildings are becoming part of the developers’ mindshare and real estate plans now take off with the green concept in mind.\\n\\nIndia, on the whole, has around 2,000-odd green buildings. This number is expected to grow high by 2025 according to the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). The new buildings will include hospitals, hotels, offices, institutions, colleges, convention centres and IT parks. Bengaluru is now estimated to have around 100-200 green buildings or buildings with ‘Green’ certification. This number is sought to be enhanced to 300 a year at least.\\n\\nApartments which are being built in the hundreds will alone help meet the target of 300 green buildings a year because independent dwellings are not growing as fast as apartments in Bengaluru now. The penetration level is below five per cent of all constructions, according to the IGBC. But the residential sector, which has begun on a slow note, is expected to overtake commercial buildings at the end of the next decade.\\n\\nM’rashtra leads the way\\nMaharashtra is said to have the highest number of green buildings, followed by the National Capital Region, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Suresh Hari, secretary of the Credai, Bengaluru, had told this newspaper that the concept of green homes in the City was fairly widespread, but the number of buildings certified as green, or that have obtained authentic green certifications was very few.\\n\\n“Within the Credai group, green certification may be around eight to 10 percent, while certification outside is less than one percent. Overall, the green building market within the larger residential market is around one percent.”\\n\\nThere are various ways in which the green concept can be implemented. Green buildings typically use less water, optimise energy efficiency, conserve natural resources, generate lesser waste and have healthier open spaces.\\n\\n“A green apartment or residence will assure you operational savings for the rest of your life even if you pay a little more for it as compared to a conventional building. You will reduce waste in everything you do within and outside the house because of the installations and design of the house, and by consuming less of everything and conserving — you save money,” says a real estate analyst. A villa or an independent house, for instance, can be designed in such a way that there is enough open space within the house to allow optimum sunlight instead of raw heat — the design controls sunlight flow into the house.\\n\\n “When you install such facilities, a green apartment will naturally cost more, but you get long-term savings. When new offers are made, green buildings are now part of the planning menu. The fact that builders give you the option of a green building means the concept is here to stay and will grow,” the real estate analyst said.',\n",

Lakshmi says she has faced rejections and that has given her the strength to fight.\\n\\nLakshmi said that she was just three years old when her parents found that she had Anchondraplasia. Lakshmi’s mother has been a pillar of strength for her as she prepared her to face the odds and cautioned her about how people would be treating her differently. “At school, the parents of many of my classmates were not happy that I was studying with their children. Initially, it was a struggle to get admission and then the societal problems. At every school and college, my parents had to convince the authorities that I was as normal as any other child,” she said.\\n\\nA painter and a trained vocalist in Carnatic music, Lakshmi has won several laurels and has always being a top scorer. She wanted to pursue MBBS, but missed the chance by a rank and took up BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) at the Government Dental College in Thiruvananthapuram. She says getting into a professional college was not easy. The college authorities had written her off, saying that she would not be able to perform procedures of dental surgery. “I did practice under one of my professors and had to use a separate platform to fit the dental chair to enable me to treat patients. I was able to even perform the extraction with ease. Patients who initially hesitated taking treatment from me, later brought friends and family to me for treatment,” she said.\\n\\nI even taught dentistry students for two years and taking the class was another challenge.

On his first day at the Royal Challengers’ nets this season, Vettori spared a few minutes to speak about his outing in the World Cup and the way ahead for RCB among other things. Excerpts:\\n\\nHow tough it is to join the IPL bandwagon after an emotionally draining World Cup?\\n\\nI \\u2008suppose many of the players have gone through it before, particularly the Indian guys. They had won it in 2011 at home and then came back and played the IPL\\u2008successfully. So, we just need to take it game by game. We had a good week of break at home to recuperate, and all of us are excited to come back to action through IPL.\\n\\nTell us a bit about your World Cup experience...\\n\\nI \\u2008think it was satisfying in many ways, especially when you make it to the final. Obviously, you would have liked to go one step ahead but Australia played wonderful cricket in the final. I think the whole team will look back at the tournament with a lot of fondness, especially the way they captured the New Zealand public’s imagination. We had some very good games against Australia and South Africa at Eden Park, then the one against England at Wellington, these are the games that will linger long in our memories.\\n\\nHow much would the WC performance boost NZ as a cricketing nation?\\n\\nI think it was very exciting for all of us to make it to the final. We played a lot of our matches at home, in front of full houses which is not a very common sight. I think NZ cricket has got a very good chance to progress from here. I would like to think that a lot of young kids have fallen in love with cricket during the tournament.\\n\\nWe have seen teams stacking up big scores regularly in the WC? Is there a need to rethink the field placement rules?\\n\\nDefinitely, it plays a part in a spinner’s performance as bowling in T20s can be much easier than bowling in one-dayers. Whether it is needed to be amended or not, yes, there’s a place to look into it as all facets of the game needed to be addressed for better balance. The four fielders rule can at times make the spinners’ job a bit tough.\\n\\n Is it affecting the quality of spin bowling?\\n\\nIt’s a part but not the only one. Sometimes, the size of the boundaries plays a part because a mishit goes for a six in venues with smaller boundaries, undermining the effort you put in as a spinner. If you play at a big ground like MCG then the spinners will come into play.\\n\\nYou had your own moment as a batsman too in the WC, squeezing a boundary off Dale Steyn in the semis. When did you actually started to think of contributing as a batsman as well?\\n\\nI was a reasonable batsman in the school and under-age levels. But at a higher level I never really achieved what I wanted to achieve. There were a couple of embarrasing moments as a batsman, and from that point I\\u2008put in a lot of hard work -- little bit change of technique, and little bit change of mindset.\\n\\nI\\u2008began to think myself as a batsman as well without restricting just as a left-arm spinner. Then in domestic cricket too I started to focus a bit more on batting and that helped when it came to batting at a higher level.\\n\\nAustralians sledged Martin Guptill and Grant Elliot in the final, but you’d remarked that you never went through Aussie sledging....\\n\\nI think it is one of things only you can deal with. I think most of the times sledging is over-hyped. The players out there is not much affected by it as sometimes it looks far worse on TV than it actually is on the field.\\n\\nAre you happy with the RCB\\u2008combination this year?\\n\\nWe are excited.

Before that Kings XI could make it to the knockout stage only once when they reached the semifinals in 2008.\\n\\nOne of the significant reasons of the rise of the Mohali-based outfit in 2014 was the stellar performances by its new signings. The franchise lost Adam Gilchrist to retirement but made significant purchases in Bailey, Virender Sehwag, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, Laxmipathy Balaji, to bolster the squad. Only six players were retained from 2013, including David Miller and Manan Vohra.\\n\\nThe team’s strength lies in its explosive batting line-up. Sehwag can tear apart any attack on his day and the owners have got Vijay with the mind to ensure a solid opening pair. If the openers falter, Kings XI have swashbucklers in Maxwell, Bailey and Miller who with their inventive stroke-making can turn the complexion of a match from any situation. Even Wriddhiman Saha came on his own at No 3 last year thus rounding off a dangerous batting line-up.  Their bowling, however, centres around Johnson. But he had been well complimented last year by Sandeep Sharma and Balaji, not to forget young left-arm spinner Axar Patel, whose 17 wickets at an economy rate of 6.13 for Kings XI last year earned him a national call up for the tour of  Bangladesh.\\n\\nAhead of the new season, the squad has organised a camp at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) International Stadium in Pune. Bangar spoke about the hunger of the side to continue with their winning momentum. “Last year was a good season for us and we would want to carry on the winning spree this season as well. We have a well balanced team,” Bangar said.\\n\\nThe squad\\n\\nIndian players: Manan Vohra, Virender Sehwag, Rishi Dhawan, Sandeep Sharma, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Shivam Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Parvinder Awana, Anureet Singh, Karanveer Singh, Murali Vijay, Nikhil Naik, Yogesh Golwalkar\\n\\nForeign players: George Bailey (captain), David Miller, Mitchell Johnson, Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Thissara Perera, Beuran Hendricks.',\n",
       "  'Royal Challengers Bangalore have always found a top place in everybody’s expectations’ list prior to an Indian Premier League season. But after seven seasons, one of the most explosive teams in the league has only two runners-up spots to show.\\n\\nMany times, the Royal Challengers have failed to work as a cohesive unit, particularly in the knock-out matches forcing them to remain as bridesmaids. However, the eighth edition offers a different picture. The team management seems to have realised the need to field a well-balanced unit rather a mere assembly of stars.\\n\\nA closer look at the team for IPL’s latest edition reveals they have retained the core of their batting -- skipper Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB\\u2008de Villiers. The troika is an irresistible force, capable of dismantling any bowling line-up. In the last two editions, the batting revolved around them, while they lacked serious talent in other spots. But this time they have recruited the classy S\\u2008Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik, wicketkeeper and a fine batsman, and the talented Manvinder Bisla. Now, there is more depth in their batting as, at least on paper, RCB will not be a chariot pulled by three horses.\\n\\nEven when the incomparable\\u2008Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan were a part of Royal Challengers, their bowling had revealed a certain vulnerability and many times that department indeed proved to be their Achilles’ heel. Of course, they will miss Mitchell Starc, the man of the tournament in the World Cup with 22 wickets, in the initial part of the league because of a knee injury. But they still have enough firepower to withstand the absence of the left-arm pacer.\\n\\nIn Varun Aaron, Royal Challengers have someone who can rattle the opposition with raw pace, while Kiwi Adam Milne — who is expected to return from an injury — and Aussie Sean Abbot, two of their new signings this season, have proven credentials in T20 format. South African duo of Rile Rossouw and David Weise, and West Indian Darren Sammy, another new recruit, can fit into the all-rounder’s slot with ease. Their spin department does not have big names but Iqbal Abdulla and Yuzvendra Chahal can be handy customers.\\n\\nAfter a while, the Royal Challengers squad has a balanced look about it, and head coach Daniel Vettori exuded confidence. “There always have been high expectations on RCB. Last year, we didn’t really meet those. I have confidence in this group that we can achieve a lot this year,” he said.\\n\\nThe squad\\n\\nIndian players: Virat Kohli (captain), Subramaniam\\u2008Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik, Manvinder Bisla, Jalaj Saxena, Shishir Bhavane, Iqbal Abdulla, Yuzvendra Chahal, Yogesh Takawale, Ashok Dinda, Abu Nechim Ahmed, Varun Aaron, Sandeep Warrier, Harshal Patel, Vijay Zol, Sarfraz Khan, Mandeep Singh.\\n\\nForeign players: AB\\u2008de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Nic Maddinson, Mitchell Starc, Adam Milne, Rile Rossouw, Darren Sammy, David Weise, Sean Abbot.',\n",

In our first year, we surprised a lot of other teams. This year, we are one of the hunted teams.\\n\\n\"So it will be about handling our own expectations. As long as we are able to play what we are capable of, I think we can have some more success,\" said Bailey, who has been training with the team in Pune.\\n\\nHe said his World Cup teammates Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Johnson will again hold the key to team\\'s fortunes.\\n\\n\"Going into IPL, the major thing is that everyone has been playing a lot of cricket. And it looks everyone is in pretty good form.\\n\\n\"The regular guys (Maxwell, Johnson, David Miller) will no doubt be key again. But what was encouraging last year was the development of some of the Indian guys like Manan (Vohra), Patel (Axar) Wriddhiman Saha, Rishi Dhawan.

He also assured the audience that the government will ensure that corruption cases against the DDA, NDMC and the Delhi Police are probed by the state ACB.\\n\\nDuring the last tenure, the AAP had asked the Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) to investigate the role of the then ministers related to oil pricing.

       "  'Type the word ‘Health’ in online Oxford Dictionary and the first definition reads: ‘The state of being free from illness or injury’.\\n\\nWhile a dictionary might restrict itself to the literal meaning of the word, there is indeed much more to health than one thinks. In this age of science, there coexists an alternative stream of medicines as well with stress on improving healthcare on the rise. Though the words ‘stress’ and ‘healthcare’ are oxymoronic, the hype around the World Health Day (that is today, April 7) compels one to mention them in the same breath.\\n\\nPlenty of advertisements on the need to increase use of olive oil; heart ailments due to high cholesterol level and even cancer of various types, have created awareness. Or at least have initiated the discussion on these crucial healthcare issues.\\n\\nWhile worrying about our heart and health in general, we omit the importance\\nof few body parts which are also important for our overall wellbeing.\\n\\nFor instance, it is a given that people don’t go to the dentist till the toothache becomes unbearable. “From the time of Sushruta, the ultimate physician in 6th century BC, when he wrote the first book on medicine, there were chapters on dental diseases and since then practices in dental surgeries have been invoked,” informs Dr Vimal Arora, chief clinical officer, Clove Dental.        \\n\\nHe shares that Indian teeth have been by and large wonderful since “Indians traditionally used neem or kikar, finger massaging of the gums and vigorous rinsing.” Unfortunately, with the change in time and dietary habits, the change in brushing habits hasn’t kept pace. Dental ailments are neglected by a majority of people which has led to excessive need for root canals and other oral hygiene issues.\\n\\nSimilarly, it has become a practice to scratch/clean the ear with foreign objects which may harm the sensitive body part. Dr Amitabh Malik, senior consultant ENT, Paras Hospital Gurgaon says, “Ears have a self-cleaning mechanism, so the best way to take care of them is to leave them alone. Often people buy eardrops from chemists and start using them without consulting the specialist which can go wrong. Even excessive use of ear plugs can cause ear pain which can’t be treated by eardrops!”\\n\\nJust as it is not advisable to ignore an earache, it is also not advisable to ignore excess stress. “Mind and body are very much connected to each other,” says Dr Kamra Chibber, clinical psychologist and head – mental and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare.\\n\\nThe people have started talking about mental illness as a ‘heath issue’ after a recent interview of actor Deepika Padukone. However, what still goes unnoticed is the effort of an individual to “accept and acknowledge that there is a problem,” adds Dr Chibber elucidating with an example: “A gentleman walked into my room and reported about his anxiety problem. He had three issues - his business not doing well, a property that he wants to put on rent and the need to buy a house. The most doable option I suggested to him was to buy the house since he had ready cash.”\\n\\nDr Chibber points out, “One must push oneself to solution-seeking”. But when we\\nare mentally stressed, even the obvious solutions don’t strike us. It is then that we need to discuss our problems with our dear ones or if required, visit a specialist.\\n\\nTo introspect the definition mentioned earlier, it is the state of being free of physical or psychological disease, illness or malfunction that should be defined as ‘Health’.',\n",

Whether he becomes like that will be known if there is a trilogy. Mr X is not a superhero because if I compare him with Batman, he would still think before killing Joker but Mr X won\\'t think before killing someone,” Hashmi said.\\n\\nThe star, however, admitted that it is his first righteous character with just a little tinge of “grey”.\\n\\n“This is the first time I am doing a family entertainer and before this I have always played devious roles. Mr X is a righteous ATS officer, he works for the anti-terrorist cell.\\n\\nHe goes through a very traumatic incident, which almost kills him then he rises from the\\nashes and he has a kind of ailment where his cells stop reflecting light.\\n\\n“This ailment becomes a boon later and he realises he has superpowers. But he is not using them to save humanity. In that way, he is still a little bit of grey. Whether he becomes a society saviour in the coming parts is yet to be seen, but in this film he is in revenge-seeking mode,” Hashmi said.\\n\\nProduced by Mahesh Bhatt’s Vishesh Films and presented by Fox Star Studios, Mr X releases on April 17 in 3D and 2D. The actor is particularly excited about \"Mr X\" because he feels he can show it to his five-year-old son Ayaan.\\n\\n“My wife has always kept my son away from my films, not that he can understand mu\\xadch but now he probably can understand more than he used to... so yeah Mr X will be the first film I can show him. He is very keen to see it because my character has superpowers.\\n\\n“I was always anxious to show my movies to him because he has many relevant questions as a five-year-old. When he would see his father holding a woman on screen, he would think he has ten other moms out there. ‘Who\\'s that?’ he would ask. So, we would cover up his eyes during a kissing scene.”\\n\\nThough there are a few kissing scenes in Mr X, something that has become synonymous with Hashmi\\'s film, the actor did not want them to be in the film.\\n\\n“I was little hesitant to have them in the film because I have already done that... I did not want to bring the erotic quotient to the film but the kissing scenes have been shot aesthetically,” he said.\\n\\nThe Vikram Bhatt-helmed film is laced with 3D effects and Hashmi, whose last film with the director was Raaz 3D, was all praise for the technology.\\n\\n“After the success of Raaz 3D, we all at Vishesh Films felt the next film would be Mr X. It took elaborative planning because of all the special effects and the concept of invisible man, which has not been played around in our country for the longest time and that too in 3D.\\n\\n“The technology has gone way ahead from the Raaz days, it has become a much more immersive experience. In fact, in this film, you are going to feel every minute there is something coming at you,” he said.',\n",

The young activists, part of the ‘Pads against Sexism-Delhi’ campaign, have received show cause notice, which they had to reply to by March 31. If the university administration is not satisfied with the answers of the young activists, action will be taken against them. Meanwhile, the ‘offending’ sanitary pads have been pulled down from the campus walls.\\n\\n“First of all, we received many complaints by the faculty members and students, who found the campaign distasteful. Even though Jamia Millia Islamia is a firm supporter of women’s liberation and furthering their struggles against injustice, this was not the best way to go about it,” says Mukesh Ranjan, adding that all the students had to take permission from the administration before starting any such activity in the university premises.\\n\\nPads against Sexism-Delhi was initiated by four students of the University – Mejaaz, Mohit, Sameera and Kaainat – inspired by a similar campaign in Karlsruhe, Germany by 19-year-old Elona, which had went viral on social media and garnered much appreciation for its attempt to open people’s minds to gender sensitivity.\\n\\n“I got in contact with Elona and talked about starting a similar campaign here in Delhi. Many of the students in the university appreciated the idea and message behind the campaign. Now more and more people are talking about the subject and this was what we intended to: Create discussion,”  Mejaaz tells Metrolife.\\n\\nKainaat, another student activist says the ‘response from people was mostly\\nencouraging’.\\n\\n“We also pasted these sanitary pads at public places like Metro Stations, in Greater Kailash and Hauz Khas markets. Though some were disgusted, there were many who appreciated and showed their support. All in all, our purpose was to break taboo and educate people about gender issues. And to an extent, we were successful in that,”\\nshe says.\\n\\nApart from the young activists, many other students in the university say the administration’s decision is not quite the best way to promote women empowerment.\\n“People who feel disgusted about this campaign should go home and see themselves in the mirror. Do they feel disgusted only by sanitary pads? What about gang rapes? What about honour killings? Do they feel disgusted by those too or is it just the innocuous sanitary pads,” says Neha, a Masters student in one of the courses of the university.\\n\\n“Even if the campaign is a bit aggressive, it’s done for an important cause and for change. Everybody should support it,” she adds.\\n\\nAnother student Farheen feels such action by the authorities can curb social activism among students. “Those who have complained against the campaign are actually the ones who need to change their mindsets when it comes to menstruation or reproductive health. I believe the campaign has been successful to an extent because it was all about targeting people having this kind of mentality and it did shake the consciousness of many.”\\n\\nMejaz says this is not the end of the campaign and the group is now planning to take the campaign to another level.\\n\\n“We received praise from many women activists for our campaign and got unprecedented support on our Facebook page.

Though the aim to celebrate the rich tradition of the phulkari fabric is still intact yet the exhibition makes use of this fabric to narrate the entire history and define the vibrant culture of the state from where it originates.\\n\\nFive potted plants at the entrance of Open Palm Court (gallery) bear the names of the five rivers that constitute the land of Punjab. As visitors step inside, a colourful array of installations welcome all.\\n\\n“Last time we had to tell people about the craft of Punjab – phulkari. But now since the people had seen it all, we decided to present them in a different manner. This is why we invited artists to create and let us showcase their interpretation of phulkari,” says Kirandeep Kaur from Concept 1469.\\n\\nThe exhibits ‘Milkpot on Cycle’ and ‘Faridkot’ by Harinder Singh (creative head of 1469), ‘Antique Juttis’ by Mala Dayal and ‘Darwaza ki Mehek’ by Anupa Dasgupta are examples of similar products showcased differently. Kaur elucidates that they “would have used some 20 odd dolus last year whereas this time there are just three dolus. Atop the cycle in the centre of the gallery, these symbolise the milk seller who used to make early morning rounds delivering milk to households.”\\n\\nAmong these 13 installations, with phulkari shawls draped on bamboo stick, is a conglomeration of village panchayat that has gathered to discuss an issue. Titled ‘Stiches of Identity’, the artwork by Anupa Dasgupta, in reality depicts the agrarian tragedy of Punjab. The ‘Phulkari baghs’ denote the prosperous and fruitful agriculture while the mannequins are styled as despairing farmers who are roped in grief. The vibrant hues of phulkari translate the despair into joy.\\n\\nAnother installation, ‘Doli’ (palanquin) by NIFT, Mohali, takes its inspiration from the bridal textile and is decorated with traditional motifs of phu\\xadlkari and other bridal finery.\\nA miniature truck and a huge handcart filled with vibrant handicrafts grab instant attention. While the truck has a mention of Hindi film ‘Highway’, the handcart doubles up as a shelf to exhibit the colourful hand fans, bags, umbrellas and everything possible.\\n\\n“We want to make phulkari the fashion statement in contemporary times and have even printed stoles in phulkari pattern,” says Kaur, adding that their focus has not shifted from the fabric. Instead, it has expanded to encapsulate the craft that is done in every home of Punjab alongside the onus of resurrecting the old Punjab in modern Delhi.  \\n\\nThere are a lot of unexpected elements in each of the artwork that make up the colourful exhibition. Yet, instead of looking mismatched and out of place, each finds its own space and garners attention in this garden of colours.  \\n\\nAs kites and umbrellas hang from the ceiling, young visitors enjoy taking pictures in this mini-Punjab created in the Capital ahead of Baisakhi.    \\n\\n‘Mela Phulkari II’ at Open Palm Court, India Habitat Centre is on till April 8.',\n",

This time round the theatre festival is spanned over seven evenings from April 4 - 10.\\n\\nPerformances by Indian Pe\\xado\\xadple’s Theatre Association (IPTA), Sehar, Bahroop, Win\\xadgs Cultural Society, Jumbish, Sri Ram Centre for Performing Art (SRCPA) etc will be participating in the festival.\\n\\nSpeaking to Metrolife about the event, Arvind Alok, directing for Bahroop said the plays mostly revolve around social issues. The play Ajanta ki Taraf was the opening act of the festival. Written by Khwaja Ahmed Abbas, the play follows Alok’s vision and was specifically chosen as a tribute to mark the centenary year of the writer-director. Alok says the play is a satire on myths in religious identities. “It will make you laugh and also cry as hard,” he added.  Earlier productions of  Bah\\xadroop have been awarded by Delhi Urdu Academy,  Government of NCT of Delhi from 1997-2013. It also participated in the last Bharat  Rang Mahotsav.\\n\\nThe upcoming plays, include Godan, on the classic novel by Munshi Premchand. The storyline follows the male protagonist Hori, who wants to own a cow. Unfortunately, in trying to fulfil his heart’s desire Hori dies in debt. The play, directed by Ramendra Chakravarty from Manthan Foundation for Research and Development, is scheduled\\nfor April 8.\\n\\n“The plays are very relevant in the present political clima\\xadte,” said Alok, adding Bahroop has actively pushed for a theatre festival in the campus.\\n\\nThe play General, Magar Sun, is about six children during war time. It portrays how the ability to associate and connect with others and a sense of duty to help people in times of need, (in this case an attack on a school by a fascist group) is a much bigger force than the horrors of war. The play is scheduled for April 9 and is directed by Manish from IPTA-JNU.\\n\\nThe closing play Eklavya Uvach scheduled for April 10 is written by Kuldeep Kunal and directed by Satich Mukhtalif. The play is an attempt by an international project by Columbia to study Indian epics, with assistance from Adima Living School.',\n",

       "  'Parents in the city, cons\\xadcious of the importance of their young wards pla\\xadying as much as studying ha\\xadrd, have raised concerns about the parks in many of Delhi’s residential areas being chan\\xadged to ornamental ones. Very few parks now allow children to play sports like basketball, football or cricket, and with construction and development activity continuously on in the city even the little space available has shrunk further.\\n\\nIndeed, the trend of playing and learning has changed over the past few years. Earlier children used to indulge in both outdoor and indoor games and have plenty of toys. The toys still continue to exist but have taken new high-tech forms of iPads, smartphones and tablets. When video game were a trend, companies started building toys as video games. With the ‘mobile generation’ parents seem to be content with tablets and phones, the new gaming tools.\\n\\n“I give my child at least one hour with the iPad. I don’t thi\\xadnk that iPads are completely useless for kids,” says Raja Selvam, father of two children, aged four-and-a-half and two years respectively. Though he considers himself in-sync with the times, Selvam feels he was fortunate that as a child he went out to play cricket with his six cousins every day.\\n\\n“Playing with friends teac\\xadhes you to accept failures. The\\xadse days students resort\\nto suicide because they cannot accept failures,” explains Selvam.\\n\\nTablets, playstations and smartphones have now become the creative tools for children. Selvam says that he gives the iPad to his children as one can draw, colour, learn phonetics and also watch videos in it.\\n\\n“There are some inappropriate advertisements that come in the middle of YouTube videos. Me or my wife always sit with the kids during that time,” he adds.\\n\\nIn this technology-driven age, children are more inclined towards tablets, play stations etc. A new segment of entrepreneurs have arrived in the business which not only targets the kids “but also helps them to explore their own creativity, through which they can play as well as learn,” according to the co-founders of Flintobox.\\n\\nFlintobox, a year-old Chennai start-up, sells toys conceptualised by educators, prototyped by designers, and manufactured by top-of-the-line printers. The toys, shipped to customers every month, have “something to create, something to read, something to play, something to explore, with a bonus fun activity thrown in,” says co-founder\\nArunprasad Durairaj. A box comes for Rs 1,095 each and subscriptions run from Rs 2,985 to Rs 9,540 for three to 12 months.\\n\\nAlong with Flintobox, there are many such businesses by First Cry, Travellerkids.com, chuckles.com, cocomoco.com, grafix.com and many others that provide such ‘boxes’\\nthat have ‘activities’ designed for children’s ‘brain development’.\\n\\nShobana Mahadevan, is a subscriber of the Flintobox and says that the box has “many activities” that are “good” for children. She says that there is a vegetable box, where one learns how many vegetables and what vegetables should be consumed to stay healthy.\\n\\n“My child now eats those vegetables,” she exclaimed. But after acquiring the facts about vegetables what purpose does the vegetable box serve? Mahadevan then says that most of the activities are useful for the first time.\\n\\n“But I am happy because it keeps my child occupied for a few hours at a stretch,” adds Mahadevan.',\n",
       "  \"Kids glued to gadgets, be it a cell phone or tablet, are not a rare sight anymore. They operate these like a professional which is not surprising as they live in a world surrounded by gizmos.\\n\\nIn such a scenario, taking kids away from gadgets is not an easy task.\\nDhiraj and Deeksha have twin boys – Manet and Manyu. They say that their children were exposed to gadgets when they were just 18-months-old. “We started showing them picture cards of animals and fruits on the devices. Soon, they could locate the relevant Apps all by themselves. They then graduated to jigsaw puzzles and quiz Apps over a period of time,” says Dhiraj.\\n\\nBut he makes sure that he regulates the usage. “We have never bought our sons any exclusive gaming gadget to make sure the line is clearly drawn. Parents must set\\nthe rules because kids can derive equal joy from playing outdoors and using gadgets,” he says.\\n\\nAmrita and Sharath believe that their children learn from example and therefore they have minimised the use of gadgets in front of their kids. “Today children are drawn to gadgets because they have no one to interact with at home. With the onset of nuclear families and parents busy at work or household chores, kids get little or no time with their parents. This is why most children turn to gadgets. My husband and I try to encourage our children to spend most of their time outdoors. We give them a fixed time for usage of gadgets,” adds Amrita.\\n\\nJose Thomas, a lawyer, has two children in their early teens. “We monitor the time they spend on these gadgets. Their cell phones are just basic models since we don’t believe in giving them high-end ones just yet. They should know what technology can do,” says Thomas.\\n\\nBut Amrita begs to differ when she says that no gadget can keep the child as creatively occupied as much as friends, family and nature can. “I try to come up with creative ways to keep my children away from gadgets. During vacations, we try to arrange as many play dates with their friends and encourage them to spend time outdoors,” explains Amrita.\\n\\nWhat starts off as an exploration turns into an addiction of sorts if parents don't pay enough attention to regulate the time spent on gadgets, say child psychologists. Dr Sugami Ramesh, senior consultant, Clinical Psychology, Apollo Hospitals thinks excess use of gadgets by children makes them insensitive to their surroundings. “We find that children who are hooked to gadgets don’t tend to listen to their parents. It’s good to know about technology but too much of it could unleash an adverse effect,” she states.\\n\\nShe feels children must be encouraged to connect to people rather than to gadgets.\",\n",
       "  'Tell me what you eat, and I’ll tell you what you are’’— the words of French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin assume greater significance today. As another ‘World Health Day’ dawns, with focus on food safety, it is time to question our food habits. The theme for this year, ‘From farm to plate, make food safe’, will probably force one to look at his or her plate closely.\\n\\nThese are days when gastronomical interests are on the rise. Food from local and global markets are filling our spaces. The challenge, however, is to identify the grain from the chaff. And keep diseases at bay. Dr H Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman – Medical Advisory Board and Medical Director – Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt Ltd, elaborates, “As far as India is concerned, there are basically two categories of diseases, infectious and lifestyle-oriented. Contaminated food and impure drinking water lead to infectious diseases and that kill more kids than any other disease every year. During summer, especially, one should have only clean drinking water and well-cooked food. Open food on streets can lead to diseases caused by bacteria and those by worms. Also, food should be kept off pests like rats.”\\n\\nThe second category, he says, is what the city-bred and the affluent eat, and that causes lifestyle diseases. This includes salted, fried and food with high calories. A bottle of Coke, French Fries and a burger — and you will be seeing a cardiologist 10 years later. “We have to be moderate in what we eat. Pastries and chocolates, on a regular basis, should be avoided. There is rise in obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes and that is starting at a very young age. You see a lot more obese kids now than earlier,” he adds.\\nExercise, say experts, should be made an essential part of one’s life, in any form. “Any exercise is better that no exercise at all and it should be from half-an-hour to 45 minutes,” he adds.\\n\\nWrong food comes in all shapes and sizes, and packets. Consumers need to read the label before putting food into the basket. Dr Kiranmai Namburi, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Hospitals says that there are five guidelines released by the WHO for food safety.\\n\\n“One should keep food clean to prevent contamination and only fresh food should be stored in the refrigerator. Food should be cooked throughly to avoid micro-organisms. It should be stored at appropriate temperatures. There are food products that need to be stored in cold and warm temperatures separately. Separate raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination. Finally, one should use safe raw materials and clean water to cook food,” she adds.\\n\\nThe concerns about food sold outside include checking of expiry date and authenticity of product. Dr Chandil Kumar Gunashekhara, a general physician, explains, “It is easy to skip details like the expiry date, but it is a very important step. Also, not all drinks that are sold off the shelves have the ‘permitted preservatives’ mark on them,” he says while adding that coloured drinks should also be avoided. “One never knows if these colours are vegetable dyes and permitted ones, or harmful ones. It’s best to avoid water and food outside, and stick to boiled water at home. Try and avoid juices sold off the shelves too, to the maximum,” he adds.\\n\\nThe food cooked at home too can raise concerns as the vegetables and fruits are picked up from the market. It is good to opt for organic food. Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief clinical dietician with Apollo Hospitals, says that “not all vegetables which are sold as organic are necessarily organic. Factors, like the farms, where these vegetables are grown, are to be considered to decide if these are actually organic products. These should stick by the CODEX guidelines for them to be proved 100 percent organic.” Organic vegetables and fruits sold in departmental stores and online websites sell are quite popular. Priyanka says, “The shelf-life of organic vegetables is two to three days as they do not have the wax coating or pesticides added to them. One can see the natural wrinkling of the product.” One can also grow food at home. “Small baskets to grow coriander and other greens are available. There are micro-organic cultivation techniques, where even a two-by-two feet space can be used to grow tomatoes, fruits etc in the balcony. Fresher the vegetable, the better it is for consumption,” she says.\\n\\nIt’s important to strengthen one’s relationship with food and that can be done by watching what one eats. Dr NK Venkataramana, Chief Neurosurgeon and Vice-Chairman, BGS Global Hospitals explains that fundamentally, one needs a systematic approach and concrete plan under a timeline to ensure good health for all. “Food and environment are responsible for 40 per cent of the diseases in India. And that is why we are considered undeveloped by many countries. The moment foreigners come here and eat something, they fall sick.”\\n\\n“Although we know that open food on streets can lead to infectious diseases, we still have it. We are unconcerned about hygiene and, how food is prepared. There needs to be quality control in food industries. There are no standards set here, no quality checks done and licences are given without any responsibility,” he adds.\\n“I recently went to a Chinese restaurant in the UK. Since I wanted to know how the food was prepared, they took me to the kitchen. They have a stringent checklist issued by the government. Every point in the list is taken care of. If they don’t, they will lose the licence or have to end their business. So even if there is no supervision, they still adhere to the list. The sad thing is we do not have any such check-lists here and all kinds of compromises are encouraged,” he rues.\\n\\n“The worst sufferers are the children. If they are not suffering of malnutrition, they are having the wrong kind of food. It’s time we changed our habits and attitudes,” he adds. Food safety is not just for the individual, but for the greater common good. As Dr Sudarshan puts it “Eat healthy, live longer, be happy.” And that is a truism.',\n",

Kannada film industry gave me an opening but I've decided to test my luck in other languages as well. I hope my entry into Telugu is the beginning of more work in that industry,” Tilak says. \\n\\nHe has completed the shooting for ‘Octopus’ in Kannada where he essays the role\\nof an investigating officer.\\n\\n“The Kannada film industry is open to experimenting with all kinds of subjects\\nand that’s why we now have a film like ‘Octopus’ which is science thriller.

I work out to stay fit and the uniform automatically gives you some kind of power and your body language also changes accordingly,” he states.\\n\\nHe has consciously worked on changing his look in the film.  In ‘Love on NH4’, Tilak is playing a con man. He states that there are three characters in the film. “I play the role of a man who believes that money is everything.

Vintage vehicles bring back a host of wonderful memories for him. “When I was a little boy, I was always fond of the Ambassador that my father owned. He also owned a Jawa bike and had bought the Ambassador in 1978. We still have the car,” he recalls rather nostalgically.\\n\\nLokesh started collecting vintage cars in 1999 with his first car being the 1950 Morris Minor. “When I was small, my father had wanted to buy it but couldn’t afford it. So when my mother was about to turn 60, I thought of buying it as a gift for them,” he says. He found the white beauty, which was on a sale in Sadashivanagar, and it has been a pride of possession for him since then.\\n\\nSoon he went on to collect the 1937 Ford Model Y, 1955 Landmaster and 1990 Mercedes Benz. The most eye-catching among these is the majestic Ford Model Y. With its beautiful red body and massive wheels, it’s straight out of the pages of history. But Lokesh’s personal favourite is the Landmaster. “It came before the Ambassador and is quite similar to it. Since it reminds of my father’s wonderful car, I love it the most,”\\u2008he says.  \\n\\nAdding the Landmaster to his collection was no mean feat. “It belonged to my wife’s colleague, who didn’t want to sell it. I had asked them many times about it and though it hadn’t been used in 20 years, the family had no interest in selling it. So I had told them to keep me in mind whenever they changed their mind. To my luck, one day, they told me that they were selling it!”\\u2008Lokesh exclaims. The challenges didn’t end there as the classic beauty had been out of use for a long time. “It took me a year and a half to restore it,” he adds.  \\n\\nIs it feasible to drive these beauties on the traffic-ridden roads of Bengaluru?\\u2008Why not, asks Lokesh. “You cannot drive them everyday but I always make it a point to take at least one of them out once a week,” he notes. He also actively takes part in the different vintage car rallies held in the City.\\n\\nNo vintage car can be serviced at an ordinary service centre and Lokesh too has a few people helping him out with the cars. “The mechanics are not always available so I have a person who takes care of the tinkering and painting while there’s another one who looks after the repairs. Since I am an engineer myself, I\\u2008work on fixing them too,”\\u2008he notes.\\n\\nLokesh would love to add a Beetle and a Mini Cooper to his collection in future. But space is always a constraint. “With so many cars, I don’t have enough space in my house to park. So some are parked at a friend’s place,”\\u2008he notes.\\n\\nDoes he have any advice for budding car collectors?\\u2008“It’s a very nice hobby but an expensive one at that,” he notes. “But it’s an addictive passion. Once you get into it, it’s very difficult to come out,” he sums up.',\n",

       "  'What started out as a passion for the arts and a keen eye for designing has turned into a venture known as ‘Urban Kala’ for Savita Iyer and her sister-in-law Shwetha Narayanan. The two bring their own separate skills to the arena and make delightful  and innovative accessories, home decor and customised goodies.\\n\\nWhile Savita is the artist who weaves, colours, customises and paints, Shwetha is the marketing head. “Initially, Savita used to gift her artwork only to family and friends. She once gifted me a clock that one of my friends took a liking to. After that, I realised that this could be a marketable venture,” says Shwetha. This was the beginning of a special bond that would form between the two sisters-in-law.\\n\\nIt didn’t take long for the rest of the family to get engulfed into their “passion”. Shwetha’s husband, Krishna Prasad, helped them build the website; her brother, Shekhar Narayanan, is the artist of some of the wired jewellery and Savita’s husband is the chartered accountant. “My brother’s earcuffs are one of the most popular items on the site – they are these innovative metal accessories that cover the entire ear,” says Shwetha.\\n\\nAccording to Shwetha, one of the reasons they started ‘Urban Kala’ was because they wanted to make the act of gifting a more personalised experience. Instead of handing over a mass-produced card or generic photo frame, one can customise a bottle lamp, clock or jewellery set for an occasion. “I remember this time when a man, who hadn’t met a group of his 10 friends in over 40 years, asked us to customise pictures of them when they were young on bottles,” says Shwetha. Their tagline is ‘The art of gifting’.   When they started out, the first product they introduced was customised clocks. Apparently they sold like hot cakes because they were “beautiful and vibrant”. After that, Savita progressed to making orders like a Calvin and Hobbes gift set, which consisted of cushion covers, clips and more. It is this personalised feeling that makes ‘Urban Kala’ unique. They have even gifted to Bollywood celebrities like Ekta Kapoor when ‘Whistling Woods International Institute’ had a 100 years celebration of cinema.  Why did they decide to call it ‘Urban Kala’? Shwetha says it was a completely random decision. “We were looking up names and we knew we wanted it to be something related to art. It was completely random actually!” she says.\\n\\nShe says each person has a different way of putting across what they want and that’s what makes this worth it. “There was this kid who saw a ‘The Simpsons’ bottle lamp and instantly knew he wanted it...and he wouldn’t change his mind,” ends an amused Shwetha.',\n",

She refuses to give a sneak peek into the season but says that the fans can expect “amazing things” like before and it gets “bigger and better” with every season.

Coming to Bengaluru, I joined\\nRitz-Carlton as the Executive Chef.  \\n\\nAs a boy, I have been appreciating food and I have tried a variety of food. It all started there and turned into a passion soon. The passion has made me realise that it is the commitment, dedication and the energy drive that makes a meal perfect. I experiment with new ingredients and try to make something up. Seasonality also has a lot to do with the innovations with flavours.\\n\\nI also keep in mind the local savoury before designing any dish. It is the curious mind that generates creativity which results in innovations of food.\\n\\nCuriosity leads to imagination, which is always welcomed in cooking. A chef should understand the concept of creation of a dish and later wear the creative hat to generate something exclusive.\\u2008Simplicity is very important in a dish.\\n\\nCooking also becomes easy when one is interested. It is the effort put behind each dish that makes it perfect. I keep myself updated with the culinary skills regularly. I read culinary books and blog sites to improve the art.  \\n\\nI have shared the recipe of ‘oats and green peas tikki’. This dish has high health value. Oats has high protein and fibre content that helps one keep fit.\\n\\nFrozen peas are the ultimate convenience food that have soluble fibres that can check on cholesterol. The other advantage of this dish is that it is simple and can be prepared very quickly. It takes about 15 minutes to prepare this healthy dish.\\nChef Anupam Banerjee, Executive Chef, Ritz-Carlton\\n(As told to Prajna GR)',\n",
       "  'The ‘go green’ mantra is catching up fast in the City and people are making a conscious effort to preserve nature.\\u2008The Vegan Bengaluru Group is one such group that is making an effort to create awareness among people about the benefits of veganism.\\nThe group was started in 2009 and aims to create awareness about veganism through campaigning, social networking and organising events. One of their regular events is the monthly vegan potluck, which is an informal gathering of people where anyone is welcome as long as they bring something vegan to share with all. It could something as simple as fruits, juice or any packaged vegan food.\\n\\nThe potlucks are always held on the last Saturday of every month in Cubbon Park, in the lawn behind the Queen Victoria statue. The\\u2008group also organises protests against cruelty to animals, vegan fairs and vegan stalls. It has members of all age groups and from different walks of life. Milesh Kumar, one of the administrators, says, “I have been a vegetarian by birth and around 13 years ago, I learnt from a friend that there was something called “veganism” where one doesn’t consume even dairy products. I was puzzled at how people could live without dairy. Due to my curiosity, I ended up reading a lot on how cruelly the cows are treated, what happens to the calves and the antibiotics, hormones, pus cells and blood that go into the milk that people consume. I was disgusted and decided that I couldn’t live with that. I then turned vegan for ethical reasons and have been one for more than 12 years now. There are mainly three factors that one requires to be a vegan — compassion, awareness and the willingness to change for a good cause.”\\n\\nHow difficult is it to stay without milk? “It’s habit and conditioning that make people want milk, ‘ghee’ and curd. For example, in East Asian countries, the consumption of animal milk does not exist. Milk is what a mammal produces for its babies. It is a logical aberration that we need to consume other animals’ milk. We don’t need any of these at all,” adds Milesh.\\n\\nDoes veganism mean giving up on all milk products? Not at all, says Susmitha Subbaraju. “There are plenty of options to replace animal milk with plant-based products. One can opt for different types of milk like coconut, cashew, sesame, almond, soy or rice milk. Then there are also peanut curd, tofu, nut cheese and many other delicious and nutritious alternatives. When a person decides to go vegan, it soon becomes his or her second nature to start reading the ingredients on the box of each product. It’s easy to find vegetarian food but you would be surprised at how much dairy sneaks into our food. The things to watch out for at restaurants are cream, ‘ghee’, curds, butter and ‘paneer’. In packaged products like biscuits, instant food and certain chips, one has to watch out for milk solids. You just have to look at the ingredients to find them.”  \\n\\nManikandan learnt about veganism from his peers and later got in touch with the vegan group. Now, he calls himself a “proud vegan”. “It all depends on one’s thought process. I have become very healthy, active and fit after becoming a vegan. The association with the group has helped me overcome the practical challenges and adapt with things in everyday life. Initially, it was a conscious effort to become a vegan but now slowly, it’s becoming a part of my routine,” he notes.\\n\\nSowmya Reddy, an active member, has been associated with the group since its inception. She believes that the increasing number of vegan restaurants coming up in the City is a great sign. “Going vegan has helped me in several ways. I have adopted a cruelty-free and healthy lifestyle. It has cleansed my body, mind and spirit. One does not have to forgo their favourite milk products if they go vegan. There are several alternatives which are not only delicious but also ensure that we protect animals. Therefore it’s a win-win situation.”',\n",
       "  'It looked like the summer rains, jam-packed roads or even the lack of electricity at the venue wouldn’t deter the Carnatic music fervour in the City. As many as 5,000 music connoisseurs or ‘rasikas’ turned up to witness a concert by the classical singer and ‘Harikatha’ exponent, Vishaka Hari.\\n\\nThe powerful singer-storyteller performed in the City recently, as part of the ‘Ramnavami’ celebrations, powered by Sree Rama Seva Mandali, an organisation that works\\ntowards promoting the heritage of the country through various cultural\\nprogrammes, at Fort High School, Chamrajpet. \\n\\nVishaka’s powerful and informative discourse on ‘Ramabhakthi Samrajya’ or the devotees of Lord Rama was interspersed with melodious ‘devarnaamas’ and ‘krithis’ by Purandara Dasa and Thyagaraja. The discourse was about the pristine love and devotion towards Lord Rama, by people from all cross-sections of society, irrespective of class, caste and religion. She elucidated this with eclectic examples; from a poor beggar, the queen of Gwalior to three devotees from various religions; to show that how each one in their own journey of discovery ultimately seeks the divine.\\n\\nShe started her discourse by saying, “One who seeks virtues like truth, love to parents and kindness in society ultimately seeks the divine.” There was no sign of restlessness among the audience despite a power failure during the initial stage of the concert.         \\n\\nLooking striking in her gold-studded magenta saree, she said that she chose the topic for her discourse on the occasion of the Rama Navami festival. Having been associated with the festival year after year, she described the City as a “family” to her.\\n\\n“The City has welcomed me every year and has shown a lot of love every time I have come here to sing.”  If classical music still grabs the attention of a niche audience, it’s the art of ‘Harikatha’ or stories of Gods and Goddesses that helps promote classical music among the young. She said, “This art is so beautiful that it comprises stories, ‘krithis’, ‘bhajans’, ‘shlokas’ and ‘abhangs’.  The audience for a ‘Harikatha’ concert is always composite. Usually, stories interest the younger generation and songs interest the older generation. But now, youngsters are growing fond of Carnatic music because the song is put into a context in a ‘Harikatha’.”\\n\\nCurrently, in its 77th year, this power-packed festival saw a melange of big names such as Aruna Sairam, Jayashree Ramanath, instrumentalists such as GJR Krishnan and even young, promising artistes like Apoorva Krishna and Saashwathi Prabhu. The coming week will include a number of concerts by Carnatic stalwarts such as Dr Yesudas and Saketharaman and ‘jugalbandhis’.',\n",

Spread across 80,000 sq feet, the comic convention was a unique experience for manga, anime, comic book and graphic novel lovers.\\n\\nThe huge attractions this year at the White Orchid Convention Centre were the two internationally acclaimed actors – Daniel Portman, best known for his role as Podrick Payne in the popular TV series ‘Game of Thrones’ and Natalia Tena, best known as the affable ‘Tonks’ in the Harry Potter series. They both took part in special sessions and signed autographs for enamoured fans. Another attraction was the ‘Game of Thrones’ special photo-op booth which had a replica of the Iron Throne.\\n\\nA special chat with Mark Millar, Ron Marz and Vandana Verma from NASA on space exploration (especially on Mars), were organised through video chat. Bollywood actors Rana Daggubati and Tamannaah Bhatia also participated in a special session on their upcoming film ‘Baahubali’.\\n\\nFor the sheer love of comics, over 11 new titles got launched at the convention. Some of these were – ‘Shaitaan’ by Holy Cow Entertainment, ‘Sirji Comics’ by The Literary Seminary, ‘Mystri PI’ by Graphic India, ‘Kaal’ by Aayumi Productions, ‘Chronicles of Ideapreneurs’ by HCL, ‘Palm’s Foster Home For Peculiar’, ‘TnT’ (Taranath Tantrik) by Speech Bubble Entertainment, ‘The Traversers’, ‘Memoirs’ by The Old Tome, ‘Leo and Capri’ by Aa Foundation, ‘Ground Zero Three’ by MetaDesi Comics and Parshu Battlefield by Orange Radious.\\n \\n Comic Con India Awards honoured Aabid Surti, a National Award-winning Indian author, artist, cartoonist and playwright, with the Lifetime Achievement Award this year. He personally came and received his award and shared his experiences with fans. He said, “I call this a rare award because only Comic Con India can think of honouring creators of comic characters and cartoonists every year. For me, this award is more precious than any other award.”\\nBut it was the fans who came dressed as their favourite comic and manga characters who stole the show. Dressed as various popular anime and cartoon characters, it was a show of creativity and the best use of waste products. Manish was dressed like Batman, his favourite movie series. He had donned a mask made out of waste products that was lying in his house. He said that he has attended three Comic Cons so far and they get bigger and better each time.\\nThere was something for everyone. From creative merchandise in the form of craft items, popular comic character badges to comic books, everything was exhibited at the venue. While there were many youngsters who enjoyed the fest, there were a few older folks too.\\n   Radhika, in her 40s, has attended two Comic Cons so far. Although it’s not a place she would visit on a weekend, she was forced to drop in because of her teenage daughter. “The popular culture in India is growing and this fest is a witness to it. I had attended the last Comic Con as well, but this time, I wish the fest had more emphasis on comics than just the entertainment aspect. Having  said that, comics are the best way to get children to read. In this tech-savvy world, the reading habit has taken a backseat; but with various genres of comics coming up, one can ensure that a child’s reading habit is nurtured.”\\nWatch video:',\n",

The Lok Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation, which is reviewing the anti-tobacco rules and heard the tobacco industry, asked the health ministry not to implement its past notification on larger warnings, till the committee finalises its report, after hearing to other stakeholders and doctors.\\n\\nBut controversial comments made by the committee chairman BJP MP Dilip Gandhi as well as by two other MPs including Bidi baron Shyama Charan Gupta (BJP) quereed the pitch with doctors and public health campaigners accusing them of siding with the tobacco industry.\\n\\n“The government of India despite admitting to high prevalence of tobacco use especially amongst children and youth and almost 8-9 lakhs deaths every year due to tobacco use, has failed to take necessary steps to effectively implement the pictorial warnings on packs,” says the petition.\\n\\nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, however, contended that the government's decision on tobacco will not be decided by individual opinion of certain law makers.\\nBesides pictorial warning, the petition also accuses the government not to prohibit sale of loose cigarettes, as recommended by an expert panel, commissioned by the health ministry. “The government is delaying framing of rules or guidelines to prevent sale of loose cigarettes and other tobacco products,” it says.\\n\\nThe health ministry, under the pressure of the tobacco industry and at the cost of the fundamental right of health of the people of India, has tried time and again to delay the bringing into force of pictorial warnings. It is now trying to defeat the very purpose of the pictorial warnings by permitting sale of tobacco products in single sticks or loose and outside its packing, the petition adds.\",\n",

Indeed, the feeling of success could be quite a heady thing, like the way one feels drifting in surrealistic world with the heart feeling all buoyant. In fact, this intoxicating thrill of success is so insatiable that the more you guzzle the elixir of success, the more you thirst to guzzle.\\n\\nMany times, it so happens that we fail to decipher the deadly dynamics behind this success matrix. Success can be highly volatile, and at times, cyclic, too. Just like the checkered careers of film glitterati in the celluloid world, wherein the film celebs in their successful years get extravagantly showered with encomiums, and suddenly find themselves facing flak the moment their career starts plummeting. Indeed, failures can make people sink in the quagmire of mental depression, especially if they had got used to basking in bountiful success.\\n\\nIn fact, it’s this strong fixation with success that actually triggers depression. A friend of mine, a gourmet cook, is known for churning out ambrosial fare of epicurean delicacies. Recently, it so happened while baking a cake for a nocturnal eve party, something went awry in the cake-making process, resulting in the dish turning unpalatable to eat, besides being unprepossessing to look. Feeling disconsolate, for days she drowned in doldrums. Here, the reason behind her depression was her obsession with culinary success. Another friend of mine, working in an MNC, is more like a linchpin to the company, wherein her opinions are greatly valued during all official meetings. Recently, it seems, one of her ideas was badly rebuffed, while someone else’s views gained more weight. Always being used to plaudits and adulations, she simply couldn’t digest someone stealing the thunder right under her nose.

When such is the case, failures can pop up even in one’s most successful phases of life.\\n\\nYes, setting up challenging goals in life’s every sphere and striving to be successful in them, do make our life significant. But being over-obsessed with success, and over-straining ourselves to see that spotlight remains ever on us, can make us get swamped by stress.

       "  'while globally, tobacco control measures are being strengthened and countries are adopting targets to end the tobacco epidemic, India has put its notification on increasing size of pictorial health warnings on tobacco product packages in abeyance.\\n\\nIn 2004, India was one of the first signatories of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the only public health treaty that guides countries to adopt evidence-based measures that protect their citizens from dangers of tobacco. Over time, several countries, including our neighboring countries, have overtaken India in implementing stronger tobacco control laws.\\n\\nOn conservative estimates, India loses about 12.7 lakh people to tobacco use every year and spends over Rs 1 lakh crore on tobacco-attributable diseases. Fifty years from the US Surgeon General’s 1964 report, which recognised cigarette smoking as causal risk factor for lung cancer, the evidence base has grown remarkably. Research in India and in other parts of the world has well established that smoking in any form causes different kinds of cancer, heart diseases, respiratory diseases and a pack of other diseases. Tobacco use in any form is harmful and deadly. One billion people are expected to die due to tobacco related diseases by the end of the 21st century and most of these deaths will occur in developing countries like India.\\n\\nThese estimates sound off an alarming siren for increasing awareness on the health risks of tobacco use. Graphic health warnings are recognised globally as effective strategy to warn people against the dangers of tobacco use. These warnings provide strong public health benefit by educating users about the harms of the habit and motivate them to quit.\\n\\nEvery time a tobacco user pulls out a pack, he or she is reminded of its deadly consequences. These warnings also serve to protect adolescents, who are lured by attractive packaging. In short, larger warnings elicit more negative perceptions about the packs and tobacco use, in general.\\n\\nOn April 1, India was scheduled to implement 85 per cent graphic pack warnings on all tobacco products, a move that was lauded globally. However, much like India’s chequered history with pack warnings since their introduction in 2009, the implementation of these strong warnings has yet again been delayed. There is a perception that lobbies connected to the tobacco industry are at work.\\n\\nA recent international report ranks India at an abysmal 136th position among 198 countries in pack warnings. India’s dismal performance on this report can be attributed to small pictorial health warnings covering only 40 per cent of one side of the pack, with which India is unable to fulfill even its minimum required mandate under the FCTC.\\n\\n The delay in implementing the warnings is primarily attributed to a report by a parliamentary committee on sub-ordinate legislation assessing India’s tobacco control law.\\n\\nThe committee presented its views to the Lok Sabha on March 18,2015 based on unfounded apprehensions of tobacco industry stakeholders about the adverse impact of imposing 85 per cent health warning on tobacco product packages.\\n\\nThe committee ‘strongly’ recommended stalling the implementation of these warnings citing its repercussions on livelihood of those involved in tobacco trade. The panel acknowledged receiving copious representations from the bidi industry claiming loss of livelihood of workers, law and order disruptions and a dramatic collapse of the bidi industry. Representations also assert that bidis are a natural product, incomparable with cigarettes and other forms of tobacco.\\n\\nBidis, commonly understood as hand-rolled, unfiltered cigarettes, are the most prevalent form of smoked tobacco with over 9 per cent adult Indians using the product. About 15 studies in India have shown that bidi smoking poses a very high risk of cancer and in many cases bidi smokers were at greater risk of oral, stomach and lung cancers as compared to non-smokers. \\n\\nChronic respiratory conditions\\n\\nOn the issue of livelihoods, processing of tobacco leaves for bidi manufacture exposes workers to coarse dust and particulates, causing chronic respiratory conditions, tuberculosis and chromosomal damage. The bidi industry provides seasonal and part-time employment, particularly to women and children and production in unincorporated units helps manufacturers evade government regulations on workers’ welfare, wages and working conditions.\\n\\nTribal populations involved in plucking tendu leaves for bidi rolling form the lowest rung of this industry. Under such deplorable circumstances, investing in alternative skills and helping bidi workers’ transition to other sources of employability would reap more dividends.\\n\\nNo tobacco control measure warrants overnight impact. Therefore, sudden loss of livelihoods and collapse of a deep-set industry are far-fetched notions. Countries like Australia, Finland and New Zealand that have reported a decline in prevalence of smoking and reduced uptake among adolescents have achieved this success, after enforcing comprehensive tobacco control policies over several years.\\n\\n The parliamentary committee report refers to many other representations which are not evidence based: claims that the current 40 per cent of pack warnings on one side of the pack are sufficiently large and clearly convey the message to consumers.\\n\\nBut research has shown that despite these warnings, the first thing noticed on tobacco packs is branding and not the health warning, thus underscoring the need to enhance effectiveness of Indian health warnings.\\n\\n Most importantly, the committee has not referred to earlier reports of parliamentary committees which have recommended that the health ministry needs to devise more proactive strategies to implement the Indian Tobacco Control Act, 2003 (COTPA). In 2013, the Committee on Subordinate Legislation of Rajya Sabha presented its report on COTPA, making observations to strengthen rules by prescribing stronger, effective and field-tested health warnings covering at least 90 per cent of the principal display area.\\n\\nThe parliamentary committee’s observations and leniency towards the tobacco industry stakeholders does not bode well for the health of our nation and public health advocates strongly demand that health warnings should be enforced without any further delay or dilution.\\n\\n(The writer is Director, Health Promotion Division and Associate Professor, Public Health Foundation of India, Gurgaon)',\n",
       "  '“In the past 70 years of my personal experience, I have never seen such a sharp decline in bee colonies. Thanks to an acute shortage of food, these little beings are struggling to survive. The nesting tree near my home shelters around 75 rock bee colonies every year but the numbers have been reduced to 10 in the last decade,” rues Subba Gowda, 95, also called jenu marana kodla Subba(Subba from the valley of honey).\\n\\nResearchers point out some reasons for the decline in these global pollinators – food shortage, climate changes, use of chemical pesticides, declining forest covers, decreasing nesting habitats, unscientific harvesting of the honey, loss of biodiversity, invasion of exotic weeds and many more. The Thai sacbrood viral disease has also left some damaging imprints on honeybees. \\n\\nVarious studies have demonstrated that due to pollination services by honey bees, yield of agriculture and horticulture crops increase up to 30 per cent. Though it is difficult to measure the volume of bee pollination, scientists have estimated that annual services due to pollination by the bees are worth 6000 billion rupees globally.\\n\\nOne of the major facts that people don’t know is that honeybees are susceptible to almost all commercial pesticides. On exposure to sub-lethal doses of pesticides, bees suffer disruption in their dance behaviour and thereby face breakdown of accurate communication of information about food resources. Poisoned queens are unable to maintain control over the hive and are often superseded. What more, honey production also gets affected to a major extent. Loss of these pollinators would result in extinction of many keystone species of plants. This in turn, has a cascading effect on the ecosystem.\\n\\nDetrimental practices\\nWhen unscientific methods of honey hunting are practised, there is a decline in the numbers. Honey hunting of Indian rock bee (Apis dorsata) is practised throughout its distribution range in south and southeast Asia. A large number of people in the State depend on honey hunting for their livelihood. Different techniques adopted to climb the huge nesting trees for honey harvesting, harvesting skills, locating the bee hives itself makes for a strong cultural and traditional link for those living near the forests. According to a study by Life Trust based in Sirsi, more than 80 per cent of honey comes from the forests in the central Western Ghats. There are instances, where a single household earned more than one and a half lakh rupees annually, through the sale of honey and bee wax.\\n\\nFor hunter-gatherers, honey hunting is a way of quickly obtaining high carbohydrate (honey) and high protein (pollen and bee larvae) foods with little financial inputs. But sadly, extension services throughout our country often ignore honey hunters while encouraging beekeepers. There’s a general belief that honey hunters are amongst the poorest workers, found only in remote rural regions. This naccessibility has proved costly for them as they get no assistance from the world outside.\\n\\nBut such a situation can be changed to gather benefits for both the parties. For one, the hunters can be made aware of producing better quantity of honey by reducing contamination during and after the harvest. Further, their products can also be better marketed.\\n\\nAt the same time, efforts should be made to encourage honey hunters to harvest honey without destroying the bee colony. They should be trained to harvest only the comb containing honey and leave the comb-containing brood intact.\\n\\nHowever, this is easier said than done. But there are some regions that have eco-sensitive traditions ensuring the sustenance of bee populations. But owing to the scale of the problem, we need rapid action across an entire region instead of small pockets. Only then can bee sustenance see true success.\\n\\nRepair strategies\\n\\nConsidering the dearth of study and proper governance mechanisms in place, chairman of Western Ghats Task Force, Ananth Ashisar, initiated activities for conservation and development of wild bees. It included study on ecology of esting trees, listing of flora for which bees visit for pollen and nectar, making a comprehensive listing of honey hunters and providing them training and necessary equipment.\\n\\nPromoting effective management of bee colonies and their habitat on a participatory basis, involving local village forest committees and forest department was also one of the tasks. Mapping of host trees having honey bee colonies, establishing Jenu vana (honey forest) by planting flowering plants that support honey with pollen and nectar and nesting trees, estricting harvesting of honey from certain bee colonies are some other initiatives undertaken by the task force. “Aiming for the better management of wild honeybees, we have initiated such programmes in more than ten forest ranges in the Western Ghats,” says Ananth.\\n\\nAlbert Einstein clearly stated the seriousness of the issue when he said, “If the bee disappeared from the surface of the globe, then man will only have four years of life left.” It’s high time we paid ttention to these little creatures and\\nensured their buzz doesn’t die.',\n",
       "  'The ability of the Amazon forest to soak up excess carbon dioxide is weakening over time, researchers reported recently. That finding suggests that limiting climate change could be more difficult than expected.\\n\\nFor decades, Earth’s forests and seas have been soaking up roughly half of the carbon pollution that people are pumping into the atmosphere. That has limited the planetary warming that would otherwise result from those emissions. The forests and oceans have largely kept up even as emissions have skyrocketed. That surprised many scientists, but also prompted warnings that such a robust “carbon sink” could not be counted on to last forever.\\n\\nIn a vast study spanning 30 years and covering 1,89,000 trees distributed across 321 plots in the Amazon basin, researchers led by a group at the University of Leeds, in Britain, reported that the uptake of carbon dioxide in the Amazon peaked in the 1990s, at about two billion tons a year, and has since fallen by half.\\n\\nGrowth stimulation\\n\\nInitially, the researchers postulated, the Amazon may have responded well to rising carbon dioxide levels, which are known to increase plant growth, but that response appears to be tapering off. Drought and other stresses could be playing a role, but the main factor seems to be that the initial acceleration of growth sped up the metabolism of the trees.\\n\\n“With time, the growth stimulation feeds through the system, causing trees to live faster, and so die younger,” Oliver L Phillips, a tropical ecologist at the University of Leeds and one of the leaders of the research, said in a statement.\\n\\nFurther research is needed, but the scientists say that climate forecasting\\nmodels that assume a continuing, robust carbon sink in the Amazon could be overly optimistic.\\n\\nAt a global scale, studies suggest that forests are still absorbing far more carbon than they release into the atmosphere, even as stresses like fires and beetle attacks increase because of climate change. In essence, rising forces of growth have been outracing rising forces of death in the world’s forests.\\n\\nPerhaps the big question now is whether that will flip. Will forests beyond the Amazon, such as the boreal forest that encircles the Northern Hemisphere, eventually follow the Amazon and weaken as carbon sinks? That would mean, in effect, that human civilisation would have less help from trees, and cuts in carbon emissions would need to be sharper than previously thought to limit global warming to tolerable levels.\\n“Forests are doing us a huge favour, but we can’t rely on them to solve the carbon problem,” Oliver said. “Instead, deeper cuts in emissions will be required to stabilise our climate.”\\n\\nNYT',\n",
       "  '“Discovery of silk is as fascinating as its shimmer and fall,” says Meera Iyer, one of the organisers of the heritage tour, “Handcrafted in Karnataka: The Making of its Silk.” As we embarked on a silk trail to unravel the entire process of silk-making in Bengaluru’s backyard, we realised each village has a yarn to spin, waiting to be unravelled in the seemingly innocuous small towns like Vijayapura and Sidlaghatta.\\n\\nOur silk trail commenced with the grainage. The owner, Manjunath showed us the cocoons kept under temperature-controlled conditions till the pupae emerge from them as moths after about a week.\\n\\nEarthern pots filled with water are suspended from the ceiling to maintain the cool temperature inside the room. I was impressed by this indigenous technology, which has proved effective for them. Mating takes place here and eggs are then left to hibernate in a cool place away from the world of colour and sunshine. The eggs are then taken out of storage and incubated. Little worms that hatch from the eggs are then shifted to a larger facility where they are fed tender mulberry leaves thrice a day. The lush farms we saw grow mulberry to feed the tiny worms.\\n\\nFrom cocoon to saree\\n\\nIn a week’s time, they hatch into tiny silkworms, which are then transferred to large flat basket ‘trays’ that are constantly filled with fresh mulberry leaves. It was fascinating to watch the wriggling silkworms munching the leaves. The tiny silkworm has an incredibly ravenous appetite and then begins to gorge nonstop for 25-30 days, shedding its skin about four times along the way.\\n\\nThen begins the cocoon or pupal stage of its life, when it begins a nonstop\\nspinning process that culminates only when it is ensconced in what looks like a neat pale yellow bundle. A day after the cocoons are formed they are transported to the cocoon markets.\\n\\nWe then headed to the silk cocoon market at Sidlaghatta. Farmers bring in heaps of light yellow cocoons, which looked like little wads of coloured cotton and stack them up filling the space around.\\n\\nAs we entered the auction house, the mood was frenzied with auction agents rushing from pile to pile and yelling out the price of each. The pace is quick – not more than two minutes are spent on a pile and the cocoons vanish from the market in a jiffy. Once the pile is sold and weighed, reelers take possession of the cocoons and the buyers carry bundles of them to the reeling units. We gaped in amazement at the cyclists as they precariously balanced large bundles of cocoons on their heads. The bundles sometimes weigh a startling 50kg.\\n\\nAt the manually-operated reeling units in Sidlaghatta, the bad quality cocoons are separated and the remaining ones are subjected to steam. Before the pupa develops into a moth and emerges from the cocoon, the cocoons are immersed in boiling water to loosen the threads to facilitate easy extraction of silk filament and the thread is sent for reeling. I learnt that it is a necessary procedure to extract the single unbroken strand of yarn in each cocoon. I found the stench of steamed silk worms a strain on my olfactory senses. During this process, the worms which have entered the pupa stage perish.\\nThe idea is to produce exceptionally high-quality silk. If the pupae turn into moths and emerge from the cocoon, the silk strand breaks resulting in multiple segments. The reeled raw silk then goes through a ‘twisting’ process which adds strength to the yarn and helps it withstand the stresses and strains of weaving.\\n\\nSilk yarn spun after the moth emerges from the cocoon is known as Ahimsa silk. It refers to the way the silk is extracted. In this process, the silk thread is extracted only after the worm matures and breaks through the cocoon to fly out as a moth. This is followed by mating and the female lays three to four hundred eggs after which both the male and female die. The breaking of the cocoons by the moth necessitate more knots to make the yarn, giving it a coarser texture.\\n\\nIn the silk industry, nothing goes waste. Strands of wasted yarn are used to weave spun silk and dead pupae are exported to South Korea where they are a popular delicacy.\\nInterestingly, India is the only country in the world that makes all four commercial varieties of silk – Mulberry, Tussar, Moga and Eri, and Karnataka is India’s largest producer of silk.\\n\\nThe origin of royal fabric\\n\\nSharing some tidbits, Meera says, “The genesis of silk can be traced back to a Chinese Empress, who stumbled upon tiny worms feeding on mulberry leaves while ambling around in her imperial garden. Later, she discovered a shimmering mass of yarn when a cocoon fell into her cup of hot water. The secret was guarded zealously for 3,000 years by the Chinese. Some bravehearts even ventured into China to find out the secret. Another interesting feature is that silk could be even older because it was also discovered recently at Indus Valley sites.”\\n\\nAfter having a good lunch at a farm house, we drove down to the dyeing unit. From the reeling units, bundles of silk yarn are sent to the dyeing units. Before weaving, the raw silk is degummed and dyed into desired colours. The dyeing unit is a riot of colours with the dyed yarn left to dry in the open.\\n\\nFrom here, the yarn journeys to the looms in various weaving units – the final stage in the making of silk. Although modern power looms are common now, hundreds of weavers all across Karnataka still work on antiquated handlooms-heirlooms to create spectacular sarees in varied designs and hues.\\n\\nWhen I looked at the silken fabrics, I thought of the sacrifice of thousands of silkworms, the small houses, the one-man units and the sweat and toil of a large multitude of the rural populace for their proverbial daily bread. The entire trip was indeed an incredible learning experience!',\n",
       "  'Situated in Bahaddur Bande village, four km away from Koppal town, Bahaddur Bande Fort holds a significant place in the pages of history. One of the prominent structures of the region, the Fort is one of the oldest (12th century) and resplendent structures in Karnataka. This sprawling hill fort houses several structures of note that include temples, a rangamantapa and water tanks.\\n\\nThough the palace doesn’t exist now, one can see its structural remains. The water tank, which brims with water all through the year, was once the main source of water for the residents of the fort. Pockets in rocks have also been wisely used to store water. Some structures here bear testimony to the santitation mechanisms that existed in the old days. Indigenous engineering wisdom employed in the construction of the Fort has helped this majestic stone structure  to retain its allure till date.\\n\\nMany takers\\nThe Fort’s rule changed several hands that include Marathas, Tipu Sultan and British. Local people have many tales to tell of the turbulent history and legends associated with the Fort.\\n\\nHistorians say that Baji Rao, a subedar of Belagavi, who was on a visit to the place, saw the strategically positioned hill and decided to construct a fort. Subsequently, the construction began and was finished in the 12th century.\\n\\nAfter the completion of the Fort, Baji Rao presented 400 acres to the leaders of the local Banjara community, acknowledging their selfless service. It is also said that saint Hathiram Bavaji, known as one of the greatest devotees of Lord Venkateshwara, lived here for some time before moving to Tirupati. Later on, Bahaddur Bande turned to be a sacred place for the Banjara community. The community has been celebrating the colourful festival of Holi at the foothills of the fort for the past two centuries in a\\ndistinct manner.\\n\\nOral history says that Tipu Sultan captured the Fort in the 18th century. Later, he renovated the Fort with the help of French engineers. But the glory was short-lived. In a joint operation, the Hyderabad Nizam and the British waged a war against Tipu Sultan and defeated him, taking the possession of the Fort. But Tipu Sultan, determined to reclaim his authority over the Fort, befriended the French, and regained the lost territorry. It is said that it was this tenacity that gave him the title Bhale Bahadur Banda. Eventually, the name got associated with the village and the Fort, which was earlier known as Guntapura.\\n\\nThus, the sturdy Fort, built on a hill at a height of 400 feet, stands as a symbol of valour and defiance.\\n\\nHistorical significance\\n\\nKoppal Fort, Indrakeela Hills and Gavimath are other important places located near the Fort. The region’s importance in the ancient times can be seen from the numerous old inscriptions found there. Two Ashoka edicts can be spotted at Gavimatha and Palkigundu. Historians say these edicts were carved in the third century BC.\\n\\nIt is on one of these edicts that Ashoka was referred to as Devanampriya.

       "  'People usually gather around to celebrate festivals, cultural events, pujas and marriages. But have you ever heard of people gathering around to celebrate sugarcane? Well, if you haven’t, then head down to any ale mane in the Malnad region to experience such traditions at their best. Ale mane refers to a jaggery production unit, temporarily set up near sugarcane fields. Juice is extracted from the cane, boiled to a semi-solid state and then poured into moulds. A special variety of sugarcane called konana katte, is grown in the Malnad region. This sugarcane is thicker and juicier than the more commonly-grown sakkare kabbu. Juice from this cane variety is very sweet and traditionally used in this area for producing jaggery.\\n\\nIn practice since ages, ale manes are becoming a rarity in today’s fast-paced world. Sugarcane growers of this region, who usually cultivate cane on a small plot in their paddy fields, are bringing in a new facet to this age-old seasonal activity by hosting get-togethers right near the production units. They hope to enlighten people about such traditional methods by giving them a taste of their own culture.\\n\\nA temporary tent or hut is installed near the kabbina gana (juice extractor). A piece or two of ginger or lemon is fed to the machine for increased palatability and some value addition. Invitees sit together on the mat spread on the floor under this tent to savour fresh sugarcane juice along with bhajjis, chips, bondas and other yummy snacks. One of the famous dishes made from the juice of konana katte cane is todadevu. This is a thin crust dosa made by pouring cane juice over a hot upturned earthen pot. It is relished either with milk or ghee. One of the major advantages of sugarcane juice is that it is completely pure and organic. So, you don’t have to worry about any health hassles. In fact, many local healers suggest this healthy drink as a cure for jaundice, both in people and animals.\\n\\nGanapathi Hegde of Kalalemakki village of Sirsi says, “I don’t look at this practice as a commercial venture. It makes me happy to see my friends and relatives enjoying themselves with food and conversations.” Along with many other farmers, Ganapathi grows around 5-10 guntas of konana katte cane mainly for domestic usage.  \\nFrom cane to jaggery After the harvesting is done, sugarcane is rid of leaves, dirt and fed to a kabbina gana. Then, the process of extracting juice from the cane starts. This can be\\nperformed either by a traditional process, where bulls are used to squeeze out the juice by revolving around an axis of wooden pole or diesel-driven power tillers. The extracted juice is then transferred to a wide-mouthed iron container called kopparige and boiled.\\nAfter boiling for ten hours, the juice turns into a semi-solid state. The mixture is left to cool and then is poured into plastic cans and left to harden. Each can of\\njaggery weighs about 25-30kg and priced at about Rs 1300-1500. Freshly produced jaggery settling at the top of the container would be golden in colour and foaming. This is called nore bella and is greatly enjoyed by kids.\\n\\nEarlier, the sugarcane tops were fed only to the bulls, but they were gradually fed to other livestock too. Normally, cane bagasse, the fibrous remnants of sugarcane extraction, was either burnt in the agricultural fields or used for composting. But now, it is also used as animal fodder as its consists of about 12-15 per cent of the total yield of sugarcane and has about one per cent protein and 49 per cent of digestible nutrients. What more, it is also used as a biofuel in this industry.\\n\\nThe jaggery from Achanalli village in Sirsi taluk is popular for its unique taste and fine quality. Farmers maintain the quality by making sure that they don’t grow cane beyond an acre. Duration of sugarcane crop is around 11 months and is harvested in the months of February and March.\\n\\nUnfortunately, varied problems haunt this sweet business. Hanumantha Gouda of Achanalli village says, “With the selling price of Rs 1350 per can of jaggery, it is difficult to meet the expenses of production, let alone making a profit out of it. From the day of sowing till the harvest, sugarcane farming needs a lot of labour. It is difficult to get farm workers as they demand high prices today. Moreover, our farms also face threats from rats, monkeys, peacocks and deer.”\\n\\nBut in totality, it is heartening to see that such traditions are thriving in this age of extreme commercialisation.',\n",
       "  'A  lighthouse is a tower designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses used as a navigational guide for maritime pilots at sea to warn them against hazardous coastlines, shoals, reefs and to ensure their safe entry into the harbour. Ancient mariners were guided home by bonfires lit on hilltops which later evolved into stronger taller structures raised closer to the sea. Sailors used to depend on landmarks for navigation until someone in Alexandria Egypt suggested piling of stones on a hill to light bonfires to guide the ships at night.\\n\\nGradually, the bonfires were replaced by oil lamps, diesel or petrol generators and finally by electricity. In 1822, a Frenchman named Augustine Fresnel invented a lens to flash the light and beam it to great distances known as Fresnel lens.\\n\\nToday, lighthouses are run by automatic machines and remote monitoring\\nbeaming out light from an arrangement of lamps and a rotating assembly of lenses. These sterling edifices have stood the test of time, thanks to their resilient and\\npractical architecture.\\n\\nMangaluru has a treacherous rocky coastline and there are many lighthouses in and around the city. The most famous one being situated at Bavate Gudde in the heart of the city perched on a hillock commanding a 230 degree view of the coastline below. Built by Haider Ali, the Sultan emperor from Mysore and a well-known engineer in the 18th century, it is made of laterite and cemented with a mixture of clay, mud and lime. It is built on a square foundation and is 48 feet high. To reach the top, there is a circular\\nstairway inside the vertical structure. From the top, one can get a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and miles of landscape once dotted with coconut palms and green fields fringing the distant Western Ghats.\\n\\nLater, it served as a base for the British from where resident commanders of the British Navy would monitor the movement of traveling ships in the harbours of Bunder Port. Though presently defunct, it is a heritage monument and has a park named after Rabindranath Tagore around it and a library dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.\\n\\nYou can find a smaller lighthouse in Hoige Bazaar, close to the old port area. This lighthouse, which was built in 1862 and located next to the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation Limited, was active just about two years ago, guiding fishing and cargo boats to enter the old port from the Arabian Sea. Poor maintenance and the lack of gas supply  for operating the lights has rendered it defunct. Hopefully, the services will be revived and the lighthouse will be restored as a guiding force to steer the boats ashore.\\n\\nThe Surathkal Lighthouse is an operational one and is aloft a massive rock. The presence of the rock has a legend of its own. According to the Hindu scriptures, Lord Ganesha disguised as a Brahmin boy, was holding a Shivalinga for Ravana while he was taking a bath. Ganesha grew impatient and placed the linga on the ground.  When Ravana returned, he was enraged to find that the linga could not be dislodged. It is said to exist even today in Gokarna.\\n\\nRavana, in a fit of anger tried to remove the linga and some pieces were scattered along the coast and the head piece fell in Surathkal and hence the name Shiradakallu meaning headstone, which later was abbreviated into Surathkal.\\n\\nThe view from the top is simply magnificent as one can scan the expanse of the coast several kilometres away. The engine room with its generator, lights and lenses are worth looking at. The lights beam in the night steering ships away from the rocky masses that penetrate into the sea.\\n\\nThe Kapu Lighthouse is another heritage landmark located about 13 km from Udupi. The presence of rocks makes the sea rough and one can experience the rage of the Arabian Sea by the ominous roar of its gnashing waves. Built in 1901  on a magnificent piece of rock standing 27.12 metres tall, this lighthouse’s entrance is sometimes submerged during high tides in the monsoon and is open from October to May.',\n",
       "  'To look at things through someone else’s eyes is a common enough expression we all use, but at The Project Vision (TPV) it is a way of life for them. Working in the area of eye donation, Father George Kannanthanam, the founder of this movement, hopes to bring sight to the visually impaired by giving a massive impetus to eye donations.\\n\\nA national survey on blindness in Karnataka revealed that nearly 50 per cent of the population had poor and impaired vision and the prevalence of blindness in the State was over and above the national average. Of the 15 million blind people across the country, three million suffered from cornea deficiencies and an eye transplant could help regain their sight again. A dismal collection of a mere 35,000 corneas as against a demand for 1,50,000 corneas was a mere drop in the ocean.\\n\\nEye donation capital\\n\\nAiming to make Bengaluru the eye donation capital of the world, The Project Vision (TPV) comes up with unique drives, campaigns and awareness initiatives to drive home the important point of eye donations. Cutting across religions and communities, some of whom have their own myths and superstitions regarding the giving away of the eyes after death, Father George has made it his single most determined aim to ensure sight to the blind and no bridge is too hard to cross in this quest.\\n\\nRecently, a unique awareness initiative called ‘The Blind Walk’ was held on the bustling MG Road in Bengaluru. It was a case of the blind leading the blind but there was a twist to this! Sighted volunteers with their eyes blindfolded were led through the busy roads by their visually impaired friends, who weaved their way through the traffic with their canes. This campaign ended with hundreds of donation forms being filled and eyes pledged to TPV.\\n\\nGirish is a blind ambassador at TPV. Recently, at his wedding, the visually\\nimpaired groom hit on a novel idea for  an eye donation drive. Along with the haldi kumkum to guests, eye donations forms were distributed and these received a rousing response!\\n\\nFather George, a priest and social worker, is no stranger to throwing his weight behind social causes. He is also involved in a host of other social projects ranging from leprosy homes to de-addiction centres and HIV destitute rehabilitation. He is canny enough to tailor in resource mobilisation with contemporary touches. Last New Year Eve, he organised a fun party where guests paid to ring in the New Year with their visually\\nchallenged friends!\\n\\nTPV runs a slew of socio economic rehabilitation programmes to help the\\nfinancially disadvantaged as blindness is more prevalent amongst the economically weaker sections. To help the blind lead better lives with better opportunities, an event like the New Year party with a twist, helped 17-year-old Suresh acquire a computer to set up his dream of a small business endeavour.\\n\\nTPV is also working at strengthening the infrastructure for eye care at both the district and state levels by having regular eye check ups and screenings at school entry level. Barely 100 km out of Bengaluru, a huge facility for affordable and accessible eye care will soon be in place to address the need and concerns of the visually challenged. Father George is putting in place many advocacy plans and programmes to ensure that the rights of the visually impaired are understood and protected.\\n\\nA national eye registry, like that for organ donation, will go a long way to\\nstructure and streamline the process where ‘first come is first served’ according to Father George, who sees many milestones yet to be reached. While Karnataka has a dedicated 104 helpline for the public to reach an eye bank, the rest of the country is yet to implement one and TPV is aiming to ensure that this task is accomplished. Recognising the strength of working with global partners, TPV has tied up with the University of Singapore for student volunteers and with SERVE Ireland for resource mobilisation. The Art of Living Foundation, which also has a good global reach, is one of its partners in India.\\n\\nYou can connect with The Project Vision at www.theprojectvision.org.',\n",

I was expecting that coming into the match, but one thing is to really expect and the other is to really experience it and really go through it on the court.\"\\n\\nDjokovic was quick to seize the initiative in the tiebreaker, racing to a 4-0 lead, and despite a double fault Djokovic had quickly wrapped up the decider 7/3.\\n\\nThe second set went with serve until Djokovic, looking weary, was broken in the final game, gifting Murray a double fault for 0-30 before the Brit belted two winners to force a third set.\\n\\nA frustrated Djokovic barked at those in his box on the change over, startling a nearby ball kid and earning a warning from the chair umpire.\\n\\nBut the Serb regrouped, storming through the third set for the win.\\n\"Of course I go through moments of doubt, as everybody else,\" the world number one said.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s important to keep those moments short...

Maybe I could have done a little bit better in the tiebreak in the first set, but, yeah, that was it,\" he said of his fast fade in the third.\\nMurray said he wasn\\'t sure what he could do differently to avoid the problem.\\n\"I\\'ve trained as hard as I can,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Maybe I could have hydrated a little bit better or whatever, but I don\\'t think that I can do a whole lot more physically to get in much better shape.\\n\\n\"I just have to try and keep working hard and see if there are a few things I can do differently which might help. He was stronger than me at the end for sure.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, the performance gave Murray more to be pleased about than his loss to Djokovic in less than an hour and a half at Indian Wells a fortnight earlier.\\n\\n\"I felt like I did many things better,\" Murray said. \"I made the match a lot harder for him.\\n\"I felt like I was going for my shots a little bit more. I did pretty much all of the things that I wanted to do tactically on the court, so I felt like I played a good match tactically.\"',\n",

So fatigue is not really a factor,\" said Bangar.\\n\\nThough he agreed that the likes of Johnson, Glenn Maxwell and David Miller remain key players, the team was not at all about them, said Bangar.\\n\\n\"If you see, the second half of IPL 2014 was clearly more about Indian players. Manan, Sandeep and Saha (Wriddhiman) did well in the knock-outs.

The body breaks down but as professional cricketers we learn how to recover from it and the 8-9 days break in between has helped us in getting recovered. I am looking forward to the IPL as we have a strong team in all the departments and it is going to be an exciting season for us.\"\\n\\nThe star batsman observed that the players won\\'t find it too difficult to adapt to T20 after playing in the World Cup and Test-series as it is easier to play in the shorter version after playing in the longer formats of the game.\\n\\n\"It is not that difficult to switch playing from the longer format of the game to T20 cricket because you can be more relaxed and expressive. We have world class players, like I said we have a lot of depth and we have taken a lot of batsmen, so we will be able to play more freely.\\n\\n\"I think it is very important for a cricketer to play stress free in the shorter formats of the game to better your performance. I think if you switch from T20 cricket to Test cricket, it will be more challenging for the batsman. IPL has always been the tournament where players enjoy their cricket and that is the reason you see a different level of performance from a lot of players, because they are relaxed.\"\\n\\nOn the changing pattern of one day cricket from the World Cup with batsmen approaching the first 30 overs cautiously and attacking in the last 20 like in T20s, Kohli said he likes to divide the game in phases.\\n\\n\"In a tournament like the World Cup, you have to play differently from the other tournaments because the risk taking is less. You know the importance of it. You want to make sure that you are 100 per cent on your game and when you are in form and you are doing well, you want to help the team as much as possible. I think it depends on the individual but I have always believed in dividing the game into different phases which works for me,\" he said.',\n",

India controlled the game for most part of the opening 30 minutes, but just lost the rhythm in the last 10 minutes of the opening half.\\n\\nHowever, it was the Black Sticks who had the first shy at the goal in the fourth minute but Hugo Inglis missed an open chance as he shot wide with only India goalkeeper P R Sreejesh to beat.\\n\\nJust when the match was settling into a good pace, heavy showers lashed the stadium, forcing the umpires to stop the match.After the nearly 10-minute rain interruption, the match resumed and India had their first real scoring opportunity in the 14th minute, which an unmarked Ramandeep Singh squandered by hitting straight to the pads of New Zealand goalkeeper Devon Manchester.\",\n",

With little transmission, and the possibility that incoming data will provide more clarity on the balance of risks on inflation, the Reserve Bank will maintain status quo,\" he said in the first bi-monthly policy review for 2015-16.\\n\\nUnseasonal rains and hailstorm have impacted rabi crops across North and Western India, raising fears of spike in food prices.\\n\\nRajan, who has surprised with two rate cuts of 0.25 per cent each outside the scheduled review meetings this year, however, affirmed his commitment to the accommodative stance, but added that policy moves will be shaped by incoming data and added that transmission of rate cuts by banks will be his top-most priority.\\n\\nApart from the transmission, other factors like food prices will also be monitored closely, he said, adding that the impact of the recent unseasonal rains will also be monitored closely.\\n\"Reserve Bank stays vigilant to any threats to the disinflation that is underway,\" he said, expecting that the price rise situation has so far faired according to its estimates.\\n\\nOn the transmission mechanism, the RBI said it will encourage banks to move to the marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination, which is \"more sensitive to changes in the policy rates\".\\n\\nOnly a few banks namely Union Bank of India and State Bank of Travancore have cut their base rates in the last four months by 0.10 per cent each, as against the 0.50 per cent cuts by RBI.\\n\\nThe banks have held on to the elevated rates even in the face of one of the lowest credit growths in recent years, which is hovering under the 10 per cent mark till now.\\nOn the GDP growth, RBI estimated a 7.8 per cent expansion in the current fiscal, stating that uncertainties on the arrival of monsoon and unanticipated global developments are major risk areas.\\n\\nOn the external front, it said a moderate and uneven recovery is emerging, and flagged the slowdown in China, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East as downside risks.\\n\\nWith speculation rife about a shift in US Fed\\'s stance to one of hiking rates, which can impact capital flows to the country, RBI said it will \"watch for signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy\", but added that the country is better placed to fight any impact with its over USD 343 billion in reserves.\\n\\nRetail inflation increased to 5.37 per cent in February from the 5.19 per cent for previous month, but many analysts expect it to continue much below the RBI\\'s January 2016 target of 6 per cent range.\\n\\nAnother factor which was supporting a rate cut included the range-bound core inflation, which is price rise without the food and oil components.

Additionally, airlines have to ensure that their staff are in their best shape. \"Pilots are subject to regular medical and psychological profiling,” SpiceJet Chief Operating Officer Sanjiv Kapoor told Deccan Herald, adding that there is no compromise on safety.\\n\\nUS sets the trend\\n\\nAviation safety rules changed dramatically following the hijacks and terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in the US. Cockpit door designs began to be integrated with locking mechanisms preventing unauthorised access from outside. Also, cockpit doors were mandated to be shut at all times during flight.\\n\\nBut after last month’s crash, caused by a single pilot taking over controls of an aircraft mid-flight, the “rule of two” has become a rallying point. It mandates that there always ought to be two crew members in the cockpit, during flight. The US was one of the earliest countries to order its airlines to follow the rule, and in the wake of the Germanwings crash, Australia and Canada have also told their airlines to follow suit, so have many other airlines across the globe.\\n\\n“We have strict procedures in place regarding the security of our cockpits,” a spokesperson of Singapore Airlines (SIA) said, not commenting further on any security matters.\\n\\nInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General and Chief Executive Officer Tony Tyler stated, “Airlines are licensed by national governments, and follow safety regulations and procedures of those governments, even with respect to cockpit access and medical requirements. Through experience and sharing of best practices, many will exceed those requirements with their own company policies.”\\n\\nIn India too, carriers have adopted global best practices to ensure that their flights are safe. The two-crew at all times rule is already in existence in India, as mandated and prescribed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “As in the US, there must always be two crew members in the cockpit, so if one pilot comes out, a cabin crew member must be in the cockpit with the second pilot until the first pilot returns. Each time, the cockpit door is opened, cabin crew must first block the forward galley with a galley cart as additional security,” Kapoor informed, adding that these rules are strictly followed by SpiceJet at all times.\\nA spokesman for India’s youngest airline, Air Pegasus, concurred. “Regarding the rule of two, it is prudent that it’s becoming a practice the world over. Even in our airline, we treat it as a law for safety of our flight and passengers,” Air Pegasus Deputy Chief Operating Officer Murali Sundaram said.\\n\\nFlying is considered the safest mode of travel in the world. But in recent months, global civil aviation has encountered a spate of aircraft mishaps.  But the industry is hopeful. IATA said the number of aviation accidents in 2014 were 73, compared with 90 in 2009. Said Tyler, “...People can take further confidence in the well-established and constant determination of the aviation industry and governments to make this safe industry even safer. Each day, about nine million people board aircraft as passengers. We work as hard as possible to earn and keep their trust....”',\n",

In the process, they contract urinary tract infections and in the long run it affects the kidneys, doctors say.\\n\\n“More women compared to men suffer from urinary tract infections because they do not urinate frequently. Normally, human beings should urinate once every three-four hours. But many women empty their bladder once in seven to eight hours because of lack of hygienic toilets in public places, workplaces and even educational institutions” said Dr Prasanna Venkatesh, consultant urologist and managing director of NU Hospitals, Rajajinagar.\\n\\nDr Ajith Benedict Rayan, vice president, Hosmat Hospital, pointed out that the ratio of men to women suffering from urinary infection is 1:3. Many women with urinary infections do not come forward for treatment because of social stigma. Instead, they try home remedies, alternative treatments and assume that drinking lots of water will cure the problem. Also, it has been found that more married women suffer from urinary tract infection because their spouses are carriers of the bacterial infection, he added.\\nWomen are more prone to this kind of infection because of their urinal passage is shorter when compared to men, said Dr H Sudarshan Ballal, medical director, Manipal Health Enterprises.\\n\\n“We get 10-15 urinal and 100 kidney infection cases a day. It is also found that one-third of women, after attaining puberty, suffer from urinal infection at least once in their lifetime. Prolonged and repeated urinal infections lead to kidney problems and studies show that over 10 per cent adults have kidney diseases,” he said.\\n\\nThe number of children suffering from urinary tract infections is also high. This is because toilets in schools are also poorly maintained, said Dr Prasanna.\\n ',\n",

This will minimise exposure to sunlight and Vitamin D deficiency. Also, parents do not let their children play in sunlight, which will increase the risk factor,” said Dr Premalatha, director, Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health.\\n\\nDr Leena explained that housebound, elderly and women are prone to have the deficiency. “Even as it is the elderly among whom it is common among, the deficiency is not associated to any particular age group.

       "  'Wipro chairman Azim Premji attending a convention of RSS-affiliated organisations\\nand addressing the delegates there is special for an obvious reason. Premji is a Muslim and the RSS is known for its Hindutva worldview, which is considered to give an unequal status to the minorities, especially Muslims. The organisation has always denied this claiming that it does not discriminate between members of any community as long as they are Indian.  It is not a simple and easily accepted claim. When it is subjected to interpretations and conditions that go with it, it is often seen as going against the literal eaning. That is why the RSS’ invitation to Premji to attend the convention is welcome. It is not always that a prominent member of a minority community has shared the RSS’ platform with its top leaders. So, Premji’s attendance of the meeting and the message that he sought to convey there are important.\\n\\nPremji underlined the need to recognise India as a great pluralistic nation and to accept the differences among its people. These differences may relate to religion, community, language, race or other categories.  The strength and vitality of our nationhood lies in these differences and the common thread of Indianness that runs through them. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also said that the status of person as a swayamsevak or not, or as a Hindu or not, has nothing to do with the service the organisation is doing for society. He also felt that the organisation should expand further to serve all sections of society.  This welcome attitude should extend to its idea of India also. Bhagwat had recently stated that all Indians should consider themselves to be Hindus. Such a definition would not be acceptable to all Indians. It is when Hindus, Muslims and Christians, or Tamils, Bengalis and Punjabis, and all others consider themselves Indian first and are at the same time proud to maintain their different identities that the nation is strengthened. It is this idea of a pluralistic nation that Premji underlined in his address.\\n\\nThe Wipro chairman also said that he considered it an honour to be invited to the meeting and to be with all those who were dreaming of and working for a better India. It is through exchange of and interaction between different views that ideas become clearer, get reshaped and gain greater vigour.  The very presence of Premji at an RSS function along with the Sangh leaders is a sign of an inclusive India. The importance of that image and the meaning of the message should not be lost.',\n",
       "  'The new Foreign Trade Policy (April 2015 – March 2020) released last week by Union Minister of State for Commerce Nirmala Sitaraman makes a welcome emphasis on the building blocks for healthy trade than on merely providing sops. The government’s aim of doubling the total merchandise and service exports to $900 billion by 2020, which will raise India’s share in world exports to 3.5 per cent from 2 per cent, looks achievable. Some of the factors which might impact the achievement of this target are external, like the global economic environment and stability of major currencies. But the policy seems to reflect the realisation that ease of doing business, elimination of red tape, and improved infrastructure are as much important, if not more, than merely designing export incentives.\\n\\nThe policy seeks to tie-in foreign trade with major government initiatives like Make in India, Digital India, and Skills India. This seems to be more pronounced with the Make in India campaign. Merchandise exports can grow only from the foundations of a sound manufacturing base. Many FTP measures directed at merchandise exports are in alignment with this. The clubbing of five existing schemes into one Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), free transferability of reward credit scrips, extension of incentives to SEZ units, provision for status holder manufacturers to self-certify the origins of their goods, promised online procedure to upload digitally signed documents by Chartered Accountant/Company Secretary/Cost Accountant, etc illustrate this thrust. The reduction in the specific export obligation under the export promotion capital goods scheme to 75 per cent of the total value of imports over five years from the earlier 90 per cent is also friendly to local manufacturing. Section III of the FTP statement lists the specific product areas which deserve focused attention. The 12 areas listed – based on a ministry strategy paper – and the highlighted hurdles faced by manufacturers in several of them, shows the ministry’s resolve to get things right in manufacturing.\\n\\nIn services, the new Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) has been extended to all service providers located in India, instead of Indian service providers, eliminating the tedium of proving antecedents. The free transferability of scrips, and extension of benefits to SEZs, applies to SEIS too. But beyond this, the policy statement merely summarises the current services environment without getting into prescriptions and identifying thrust areas. More was expected from the FTP here. But despite this, the new policy is a welcome road map for India’s trading community.',\n",
       "  \"The framework agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme reached by Tehran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members plus Germany is the first step in a protracted process of ending the isolation and ostracism of Iran, a key West Asian power, imposed primarily by the US after the 1979 overthrow of the Shah.\\n\\nThe 18-month negotiations between Iran and the six powers has already brought Iran “in from the cold.” The US-Iran relations have dramatically changed on both the governmental and popular levels. The US is not seen by the current Iranian government as a permanent enemy or by most Iranians as “the great satan.” The Obama administration is prepared to deal with Tehran. A total of 59 per cent of US citizens favour a comprehensive agreement that would ensure that Iran, a signatory of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), will not join India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea in the club of non-NPT nuclear weapons states.\\n\\nIran’s relations with Europe, Africa and Asia should also warn while Saudi Arabia and some of its Gulf allies, which see Iran as a competitor for regional influence, are likely to remain antagonistic. Israel, which regards Iran as an implacable foe, will continue to be hostile to any deal. The last thing the Saudis and Israelis want is for Iran to emerge from behind the wall of punitive sanctions raised by the US round the country and reinforced within by Iranian hardliners determined to retain total “independence.”\\n\\nIran’s emergence will inevitably boost its political and economic standing both on regional and world stages. A country of 80 million people, Iran is certain to be courted by global firms seeking trade deals and by governments lobbying for support on political issues.\\nWhile Saudi Arabia will not welcome this “opening,” its Gulf allies, particularly the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are likely to see the financial and commercial opportunities created by the reinstatement of Iran. Dubai-based Iranian-Canadian consultant, Ali Bourhani said that the UAE is in a unique position to promote trade between Iran and the West.\\n\\nAs the deal was announced in the Swiss city of Lausanne, Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran and the country’s other major cities to cheer. They had two reasons for celebration: the framework respects Iran’s right to a nuclear programme as enshrined in the NPT and mandates the lifting of sanctions that have cut Iran’s oil exports by 59 per cent, shrunk its economy by 20 per cent, and deprived millions of Iranians of a decent standard of living and ailing Iranians of essential medicines.\\n\\nOn the domestic front, a revival of an economy beset by double-digit inflation and high unemployment would strengthen the hand of the pragmatists around President Hassan Rouhani in the power struggle with hardliners in the Republican Guards and parliament.\\nIran expects an early injection of cash from the release of $100 billion in foreign banks and the transfer of $9 billion by India and $25 billion by China in payments for oil held up by financial sanctions. A large proportion of this money could be invested in Iran’s underdeveloped oil sector. Multinationals are eagerly waiting to conclude contracts.\\n\\nMajor breakthrough\\n\\nIran could also resume exports at about one million barrels a day of oil which has been harvested from wells and stored on ships waiting for the signal to make deliveries to the country’s main customers, India, China, Japan and South Korea. There could be some delay, however, because financial sanctions could take months to bring to an end. Exports have been dramatically cut by sanctions preventing banks from making payments and insurance companies from insuring cargoes.\\n\\nUS President Barack Obama, who hailed the framework as a major breakthrough, has pledged to suspend financial sanctions through executive action but unless Congress formally lifts sanctions, the punishments for sanctions-busters will remain, particularly since the Republicans are in control of both Houses and not only oppose but also threaten to torpedo any agreement.\\n\\nOn the West Asian political front, a deal on the nuclear programme could encourage a no longer sanctioned and politically besieged Iran to adopt a less aggressive stance in regional affairs, reducing Shia-Sunni sectarian rivalries, and promote a “grand bargain” that would ease tensions with Sunni Muslim neighbours fearful of Shia Iran's involvement in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and, lately, Yemen.\\n\\nIran could deal with their concerns immediately by calling for a political settlement in Yemen between Shia Houthis and Saudi-backed President Abdul Rabu Mansur Hadi and by ensuring that Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militias do not abuse, cleanse or kill Sunnis in areas liberated from Islamic State (IS) fighters.\\n\\nThe Lausanne accord could also make it easier for Tehran and Washington to coordinate the air and ground campaigns against IS and Jabhat al-Nusra in Iraq and Syria. Even before the breakthrough in Lausanne, Iran and the US had been cooperating in the battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan, showing where they is a will, there can be a way to get along.\",\n",

Censorship can be harshly imposed on media, he said.\\n\\nSuch developments, along with the corporatisation of media has posed severe threats to the civil society. Corporatisation of media has provided tools for the governments to suppress truth, he said, quoting the media campaign of the USA, before it bombed countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Iraq. US government used the media to deceive the whole world, before truth came out, he said.\\n\\nParameters\\nReferring to an American linguist’s book ‘Manufacturing Consent’, he said, media is being used to manufacture consent in third world, so that people believe that development and growth are the only parameters of welfare in a democracy.  Experts, who appear on television channels, do not seem to consider that equality is also an important aspect for welfare, he said.\\n\\nAnother emergency\\nDue to such manipulative tactics, the world as a whole faces another emergency. “During the past two centuries, the public sphere and its activities was reinforced by the middle class. However, the opportunistic middle class of the modern day has threatened the public sphere,” he said.\\n\\nDecisions of some media organisations, fuelled by corporatisation, has threatened the democratic setup of media houses, he said.\\n\\nThe greatest danger today is that media can be easily used to manufacture evidence and witnesses. Empirical data is also being manipulated to push ideological aspects of a political party or a government, he said.\\n ',\n",

       "  'Central Coffee Research Institute in Chikkamagaluru under the administrative control of Coffee Board has come out with a comprehensive recommendation on control of coffee stem borer, which will help Indian Coffee sector to overcome the threat posed by the pest.\\n\\nCoffee Board Chairman  Jawaid Akhtar said to find a solution to the problem of borer disease, CCRI had carried out a series of field trials during 2014 to find out ways and means of killing the stages of coffee stem borer within the affected plants so as to prevent spread of infestation. A few methods like stem injection and root feeding of systemic pesticides, coating with sealer cum healer, stem wrapping with insecticide treated material etc were tried.\\n\\nIn one such experiment, infested plants showing typical symptoms (of ridges on main stem, yellowing and slight wilting) were marked and the main stem was wrapped using gunny bag strips. The gunny bag cover on main stem was sprayed with an insecticide formulation containing Chlorpyrifos 50EC + Cypermethrin 5EC at the dosage of 1.2ml/ litre of water along with 1 ml of a wetting agent. After completion of flight, gunny wrapped plants were examined for status of the stem borer stages. It was observed that in almost all infested plants, adult beetles were found to be dead at the tip of the emergence hole.  This is for the first time it has been demonstrated successfully that the adult beetles of stem borer could be killed before their emergence.  If the adult beetles are prevented from emergence, then there is immense possibility of reducing the stem borer infestation levels within a short span, he added.\\n\\n“The coffee white stem borer is a serious pest affecting Arabica coffee in India which is reported to be responsible for an estimated loss of about 0.5 million plants each year resulting a crop loss of about 1,500 tonnes per annum,” he said. In view of the encouraging results in the preliminary trials, the CCRI has planned elaborate multi-location field trails during the pre-monsoon flight season of this year (April-May) to validate the results on a large scale.\\n\\n“The coffee growers may try this method on their fields on a limited area to quickly validate the results in their estates. The method involves wrapping of the main stems of stem borer infested plants with strips of gunny bags and spraying the covered stem with an insecticide formulation containing Chlorpyrifos 50EC + Cypermethrin 5EC at the dosage of 1.2ml/ litre of water along with 1 ml of a wetting agent. The above method of treating the infested plants should be completed before as soon as possible preferably before end of April and October months. By doing so it would be possible to drastically reduce the population of the stem borer beetles which would go a long way to gain control over this dreaded pest of Arabica coffee, he added.\\nFor details, growers can contact Director of Research, Central Coffee Research Institute, Coffee Research Station Post, Chikkamagaluru District, Phone— 08265-243029 or 94800 75930, email dr.coffeeboard@nic.in  \\n ',\n",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said in a recent report that over a billion young people are at risk of permanent hearing loss.\\n\\nShelly Chadha, prevention of deafness and hearing loss technical officer for WHO, said the danger with smartphones is that many people are listening to music that is simply too loud.\\n\\n\"Anything where you\\'re putting sound into the eardrum, that\\'s something as a society that we need to take a closer look at,\" Rex Banks, chief audiologist at the Canadian Hearing Society, was quoted as saying by CBC.ca.\\n\\nThat\\'s because loud noises damage the cilia of the inner ear, the tiny hair-like structures that change sound waves into electrical signals that are carried to the brain. The damaged cilia never grow back.\\n\\n\"Once they\\'ve been damaged, that\\'s irreversible,\" Banks said.Compounding the problem is the fact that people often listen to music when they are out on the street or in the subway where there is a lot of other background noise.\\n\\nMost earphones that come with smartphones and MP3 players do a poor job of blocking ambient street noise. So in noisy urban environments, users frequently turn up the volume to maximum in order to overcome the din of city life, Banks said.\\n\\nA normal speaking voice usually measures around 60 decibels. Volumes above 85 decibels will cause damage after about eight hours and levels above 100 decibels can do so in 15 minutes.\\n\\nOne solution to the problem could be noise-cancelling earphones that can block ambient sound and allow music lovers to listen to their music at lower and safer volumes.',\n",
       "  \"India’s journey into placing its own satellite in outer space using indigenous launchers started with the modest goal of launching a 40 kg satellite into a 400 km circular orbit. This was achieved in 1980 with the development of the SLV 3.\\n\\nThirty five years since then, and having traversed enormous, and often difficult, ground in its space capabilities, India placed the IRNSS – 1D into space on March 28, 2015. This is the fourth of the constituents of GAGAN - the Indian GPS-Aided Geo Augmented Navigation system – that India started launching from July 1, 2013 to put in place its own geospatial positioning system.\\n\\nStarting small, India plans to put into place a regional (not a global) positioning system with the help of seven such satellites initially, going up to 11 eventually, which would provide it positional accuracy of 10 m over the Indian landmass and 20 m over a range of 1500-2500 km from the Indian border. For comparison, it may be stated that the US\\n\\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLONASS comprise of 24 satellites each and provide global coverage through a global network of stations. So, will the Chinese Beidou comprising of 35 satellites.\\nIn the case of India, however, the initial plans were to build ground stations only on Indian territories. All seven satellites were to be placed at a height of 36,000 km. Three of them were to be in the geostationary orbit just over the equator while the remaining four would be in pairs in two inclined geosynchronous orbits. The system would assist navigation, vehicle tracking and fleet management, integration with mobile phones besides providing the more restricted encrypted service for the military and other government users.\\n\\nSpearheaded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Indian space programme has primarily been tailored to meet socio-economic and scientific objectives. The focus was decided early as concentrating on applications that were most needed and best suited to uplifting the quality of life of the Indian masses to facilitate societal transformation.\\n\\nWith this precise objective in view, India built a goal oriented applications programme where the initial research and development energies and investments were spent on launching communication satellites for enabling mass education, meteorology satellites for the benefit of a predominantly agricultural economy (with collateral benefits of disaster predictions and management) and remote sensing satellites for better resources utilisation.\\n\\nThis dedicated approach has made India a big time user and beneficiary of space based applications for the socio-economic growth and development of the country. The country, however, is fledgling in exploiting the benefits of the high ground for its military needs.\\nIn fact, India's space programme is unique to have wilfully and consistently maintained a peaceful orientation. It is only in recent times, no more than in the last five years, that the country has launched earth observation (RISAT series), navigation (IRNSS series) and communications (GSAT) in service of the defence forces of the nation.  \\n\\nIndia's security challenges emanate primarily from its nuclearised neighbours. Considering this reality, a crisis situation is likely to demand capabilities of an order that can accurately assess the adversary's intent and actions with penetrating and persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and domain awareness. Modernised sensors and platforms as well as robust, agile and resilient communication networks are critical to this requirement. Space enabled applications, in turn, are crucial to ensure these. With this understanding, India has begun to invest in some dedicated military satellites.\\n\\nWhile the country is steadfastly against the weaponisation of outer space, the use of this medium for military applications falls within the purview of peaceful uses of outer space as interpreted under the Outer Space Treaty (of which India is a member). India cannot afford to ignore these military support functions. As more dedicated military satellites are launched, India would be able to better utilise the benefits of space for force enhancement and other support functions.\\n\\nIntegration of missions\\n\\nThe former will enhance deterrence by exhibiting better capability to execute war fighting through superior control over and integration of missions such as communications, early warning, ISR, targeting, meteorology, navigation etc. These capabilities will allow India to discern the actions of its adversaries better, observe the battlefield more clearly to anticipate likely events, and respond with greater speed and precision.\\n\\nGiven the vantage position, persistence and pervasiveness offered by assets in outer space, the military advantages of real time information and timely action cannot be discounted. One can read the adversary better from one’s own side and manage own forces more effectively.\\n\\nSpace based sensors offer the advantage of not deploying troops in forward areas for ISR, thereby keeping them out of harm’s way and making it possible to exploit short-lived opportunities by coordinating and synchronising attack assets to conduct precise operations. Meanwhile, having others know that you know what is happening and that you can respond quickly can be a powerful deterrent by itself.\\n\\nA network of earth observation, radar imaging, ISR, meteorology, navigation and communication satellites can offer a tremendous advantage for operations on earth. Obviously, given its threat perceptions, India cannot afford to ignore the benefits of force multiplication that can be achieved through the exploitation of outer space.\\n\\n(The writer is Senior Fellow affiliated with the Centre for Air Power Studies, New Delhi)\",\n",

Currently, there is limited understanding of the total estimates in deaths from food safety-related issues.  \\n\\n“India also does not know the exact burden of all foodborne illnesses,” said Bhushan.\\nCSE researchers have pointed out the unregulated use of pesticides. Pesticides are linked to long-term health effects such as endocrine disruption, birth defects and cancer.\\n\\nBesides raw agriculture produce, pesticides have been found in packaged food products such as soft drinks and bottled water. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics for mass disease prevention is also a common practice.

       "  'Tell me what you eat, and I\\'ll tell you what you are\\'\\'- the words of French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin assume greater significance today. As another \\'World Health Day\\' dawns, with focus on food safety, it is time to question our food habits. The theme for this year, \\'From farm to plate, make food safe\\', will probably force one to look at his or her plate closely.\\n\\nThese are days when gastronomical interests are on the rise. Food from local and global markets are filling our spaces. The challenge, however, is to identify the grain from the chaff. And keep diseases at bay. Dr H Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman - Medical Advisory Board and Medical Director - Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt Ltd, elaborates, \"As far as India is concerned, there are basically two categories of diseases, infectious and lifestyle-oriented. Contaminated food and impure drinking water lead to infectious diseases and that kill more kids than any other disease every year. During summer, especially, one should have only clean drinking water and well-cooked food. Open food on streets can lead to diseases caused by bacteria and those by worms. Also, food should be kept off pests like rats.\"\\n\\nThe second category, he says, is what the city-bred and the affluent eat, and that causes lifestyle diseases. This includes salted, fried and food with high calories. A bottle of Coke, French Fries and a burger - and you will be seeing a cardiologist 10 years later. \"We have to be moderate in what we eat. Pastries and chocolates, on a regular basis, should be avoided. There is rise in obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes and that is starting at a very young age. You see a lot more obese kids now than earlier,\" he adds.\\n\\nExercise, say experts, should be made an essential part of one\\'s life, in any form. \"Any exercise is better that no exercise at all and it should be from half-an-hour to 45 minutes,\" he adds.\\n\\nWrong food comes in all shapes and sizes, and packets. Consumers need to read the label before putting food into the basket. Dr Kiranmai Namburi, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Hospitals says that there are five guidelines released by the WHO for food safety. \"One should keep food clean to prevent contamination and only fresh food should be stored in the refrigerator. Food should be cooked throughly to avoid micro-organisms. It should be stored at appropriate temperatures. There are food products that need to be stored in cold and warm temperatures separately. Separate raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination. Finally, one should use safe raw materials and clean water to cook food,\" she adds.\\n\\nThe concerns about food sold outside include checking of expiry date and authenticity of product. Dr Chandil Kumar Gunashekhara, a general physician, explains, \"It is easy to skip details like the expiry date, but it is a very important step. Also, not all drinks that are sold off the shelves have the \\'permitted preservatives\\' mark on them,\" he says while adding that coloured drinks should also be avoided. \"One never knows if these colours are vegetable dyes and permitted ones, or harmful ones. It\\'s best to avoid water and food outside, and stick to boiled water at home. Try and avoid juices sold off the shelves too, to the maximum,\" he adds.\\n\\nThe food cooked at home too can raise concerns as the vegetables and fruits are picked up from the market. It is good to opt for organic food. Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief clinical dietician with Apollo Hospitals, says that \"not all vegetables which are sold as organic are necessarily organic. Factors, like the farms, where these vegetables are grown, are to be considered to decide if these are actually organic products. These should stick by the CODEX guidelines for them to be proved 100 percent organic.\" Organic vegetables and fruits sold in departmental stores and online websites sell are quite popular. Priyanka says, \"The shelf-life of organic vegetables is two to three days as they do not have the wax coating or pesticides added to them. One can see the natural wrinkling of the product.\" One can also grow food at home. \"Small baskets to grow coriander and other greens are available. There are micro-organic cultivation techniques, where even a two-by-two feet space can be used to grow tomatoes, fruits etc in the balcony. Fresher the vegetable, the better it is for consumption,\" she says.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to strengthen one\\'s relationship with food and that can be done by watching what one eats. Dr NK Venkataramana, Chief Neurosurgeon and Vice-Chairman, BGS Global Hospitals explains that fundamentally, one needs a systematic approach and concrete plan under a timeline to ensure good health for all. \"Food and environment are responsible for 40 per cent of the diseases in India. And that is why we are considered undeveloped by many countries. The moment foreigners come here and eat something, they fall sick.\"\\n\\n\"Although we know that open food on streets can lead to infectious diseases, we still have it. We are unconcerned about hygiene and, how food is prepared. There needs to be quality control in food industries. There are no standards set here, no quality checks done and licences are given without any responsibility,\" he adds.\\n\\n\"I recently went to a Chinese restaurant in the UK. Since I wanted to know how the food was prepared, they took me to the kitchen. They have a stringent checklist issued by the government. Every point in the list is taken care of. If they don\\'t, they will lose the licence or have to end their business. So even if there is no supervision, they still adhere to the list. The sad thing is we do not have any such check-lists here and all kinds of compromises are encouraged,\" he rues.\\n\\n\"The worst sufferers are the children. If they are not suffering of malnutrition, they are having the wrong kind of food. It\\'s time we changed our habits and attitudes,\" he adds. Food safety is not just for the individual, but for the greater common good. As Dr Sudarshan puts it \"Eat healthy, live longer, be happy.\" And that is a truism.',\n",
       "  'Their lengths have been altered often to suit the latest trends. Be it long or short, skirts have alwaysbeen popular. While the length kept getting shorter in the olden days, it looks like the longer, fuller and wider skirts are back in fashion. And with the City getting hotter by the day, one can spot people wearing colourful maxi skirts as they give some respite from the scorching heat. The short skirts of the 70s are still in vogue among the teenagers. Yet, it is the maxi skirts that are selling like hot cakes this spring-summer. Besides, their comfort factor makes one opt for them.\\n\\nAesthetic prints, front slits and bright colours...these maxis, like the boyfriend jeans, have become a girl’s best friend. They are mostly adored for their simplicity and  they can be those attire that come in handy when one feels that there is nothing apt to wear for an occasion. Divya, a graduate, is wearing a skirt from Biba that has varied prints in bright colours. She has paired it with a colourful top to give it a bright look. She says that a skirt is the most comfortable piece of clothing and add colour in the hot weather. Casual or formal, work or party; one can go for the everyday look or the classy one depending on the skirt one chooses.\\n\\n“I like wearing skirts and also I like accessorising them. The hairdo also complements the look,” says Shloka Durga, a professional. She adds that skirts help hide skinny legs and make one look taller. While maxis have moved to the future from the past, they have also undergone many alterations that have made them popular. There are many who are adapting to new styles, which are short in the front and have a trail behind. So it is not that the short is out and long is in. It is the combination of both short and long skirts that are trending this season.\\n\\nNamratha Prakash, a professional, stitches her own skirts and alters their style according to her needs. “The most flexible of apparels — skirts, are a boon this hot summer. The different styles and cuts can be matched with a wide variety of tops and they can be worn everyday just like jeans.” Halter neck tops, crop tops, formal shirts, regular T-shirts....anything can go well with the maxis. The maxis too, come in different shapes and colours, that include — A line skirt, tribal print skirt, single colour skirt, flaired skirts, front or side slit skirts, pleated skirt and the sarong or the wrap-around skirts. \\n\\n“Wrap-around skirts are very comfortable and stylish. They can be matched with a variety of tops to suit the occasion. While a crop top gives it a stylish look, a simple T-shirt can go well for a work or college environment,” says Mary, a student. Sadia says, “The summer is hot and these skirts don’t stick to the body. They are much cuter and better than the\\nbaggy pants as they have a fine feminine quality about them.”\\n\\nA student from Mount Carmel College, Sushmitha, says, “Skirts add that special feminine touch to the look and they get out the lady charm. They also make shorter people look tall, because of the illusion of long legs. They can be made to look western or ‘desi’ depending on how you style them,” she wraps up.',\n",

The script is interesting and the songs are refreshing,” she adds.  \\n\\nWhile Sophie continues to compose, perform and churn out new albums, she has also tried her hand at dancing in   ‘Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa’.

Whether it’s a poster, card or invitation, the item becomes more desirable once it is a unique and personalised piece. \\n\\nThis is what drives ‘Illustration Much’, a start-up founded by Gaurav Hablani, Taaneya Balaji, Sruthi Das and Soma. Ian Crasta is the newest member of the team. As the name suggests, they have an inclination for illustrations and make it a point to be as innovative and creative as possible. Whether it’s a greeting card, wedding invitation, poster, booklet or menu, the group will illustrate it for you in their own unique way. “What makes us different is that we are illustration driven,” says Gaurav.\\n\\nThe four (Gaurav, Taaneya, Sruti and Soma) were initially batchmates in Symbiosis Institute of Design. Gaurav says that they moved to Bengaluru in search of jobs but ended up starting ‘Illustration Much’. “Within two to three months of starting our jobs, we realised we weren’t doing enough. We were all interested in illustration so Taaneya suggested we put out a few of our works at ‘Kitsch Mandi’,” he adds. At the flea market, they got a good response and some business opportunities.\\n\\nSoon the four were overloaded with work from ‘Illustration Much’ and decided it was a good time to make it a full-time business. Gaurav says they all waited until they had six months work experience before quitting their jobs.\\n\\nIt has been two-and-a-half-years since they began and the journey has been a long one. When Soma decided to part ways with the group, it was Ian who stepped in. And although they have different specialisations, they use it to their advantage. “I’ve studied animation while Taaneya and Sruthi are graphic designers and Ian is a product designer. While each of us can adapt to any style of design, I draw a little more flat and adult-like, Taaneya’s work has more texture to it and Sruthi does cute and adorable things,” says Gaurav.\\n\\nHow did they come up with the name? “It was the night before ‘Kitsch Mandi’ and we were prepping. If it’s a single person, you can identify them with their name, but that’s not the case with a group. A friend came over and suggested we have a name. He suggested ‘Illustration Station’ but it was too long. Instead we decided on ‘Illustration Much’ since we wanted the word ‘Illustration’ in the name,” says Gaurav. Ironically, it was the friend who created the logo for the designer bunch. “We weren’t in a mind frame to become a start-up...we were just thinking about showcasing our work,” he adds.\\n\\nWhile they have worked on a number of products, Gaurav says wedding invitations are their favourite because they give them creative and artistic freedom. “We want our cards to have a certain personality, reflect the people they are made of and tell their stories,” he ends.',\n",

       "  'Born and brought up in Goa, DJ\\u2008Anish Sood has music in his blood. After all, his father and uncle are jazz guitarists. Having made a name for himself in the world of DJing, he is very excited about his track ‘Superfly’, which releases on iTunes today.\\n\\nHe has collaborated on the song with popular singer Anushka Manchanda and up-and-coming dance music producer Nanok. The catchy song is a perfect balance of popstar Anushka’s vocals and the dance music-making abilities of both Anish and Nanok. “I met Anushka through a common friend last year and I knew who she was. Since I wanted to work with new artistes, I thought why not work on something that blended both our styles,”\\u2008recalls Anish.\\n \\n“The initial idea to collaborate with Anushka was to write something in the pop-dance crossover space,” says Anish. “I definitely wanted to incorporate Anushka’s pop sensibilities into the track and also wanted to retain the dancefloor element without sounding too generic. I accidentally stumbled upon Nanok’s SoundCloud and got in touch with him because I really liked his sound,” he adds. The trio worked on the song for a long time. “It took longer than we expected. We worked on it from May to September last year, and then wanted to give some finishing touches to it. So by January, it was ready and we are all happy with the way it has turned out. I think ‘Superfly’ reflects all our styles very distinctly. We’ve kept the production clean and fresh and the arrangement has strong a radio appeal as well,” he says.\\n\\nThe interesting part of the song is the technology involved in creating it. “It was completely produced over the internet,” says Anish and adds, “Most of the time, we were in different places. While Nanok and Anushka were in two different corners of Mumbai, I was in Goa.”\\nAnish hopes to hit the road soon along with Anushka and Nanok to promote the single.\\u2008And of course, Bengaluru is on the cards too.\\n\\n“Bengaluru has a great music scene and I have been playing in the City for the last five to six years,”\\u2008he adds. He also hopes to make a video and remix of the song soon. “We are hoping to shoot the video by the last week of May or the first week of June,”\\u2008he notes. “I also am working on more solo tracks and other collaborations,” he says. As someone “whose inspiration changes everyday”, Anish says his current favourites are Porter Robinson, Maceo\\u2008Plex and Adriatique. He likes AR\\u2008Rahman’s works too. “He is someone who pushes the boundaries,” he says. Would he ever make music for a film?\\u2008“Sadly, most songs in Bollywood today are rehashed. Many of them are just dance music with some Hindi vocals. But if I get something offbeat which is closer to my style and is a fluid collaboration, I will definitely take it up. After all, the musicality of an artiste should not be taken away,” he adds.\\n\\nWith a bunch of tours lined up, Anish hopes to visit Croatia this year. He also dreams of performing at Tomorrowland. “The way it is organised with so much energy put into it, Tomorrowland is a different ballgame altogether,” he sums up.',\n",
       "  'A better standard of living and the multiple opportunities available in Bengaluru are what lured Ngangbam Kishor from Silchar, Assam to the Garden City almost a decade back. Kishor, who works as a lead designer with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), lives with wife Babita Singha and son Vihaan, and the couple have adjusted well to the City.\\n\\n“Back home, there were not many educational opportunities. I came to Bengaluru to do my diploma in computer science and started off with a job in an agency. After this I did BTech in computer science (correspondence). During that time, the IT sector was booming and most of my college seniors and friends got jobs here. I felt encouraged to stay on,” narrates Kishor. Kishor feels blessed to be in the City as he believes that he couldn’t have got the opportunities he got here elsewhere. “Bengaluru gave me my bread and butter,” he says.\\n\\nKishor has the best to say about his life here. “Not knowing the local language was a challenge in the beginning as it wasn’t easy to move around. But I love the City for its ‘cosmopolitan nature’,” he says. “One can find people from all over the world here. This is one of the biggest advantages of the City,” he says.\\n\\n“My college life was a lot of fun. We all used to hang out and roam around Lalbagh and on MG Road. I met a lot of people at different places. People here are very lively. They are also very accepting,” he says.\\n\\n“But then, there are some who stare at you when they realise that you are not from here,” he says. “There are also some others who assume that people from the North-East generally migrate here to work as a security guard. Once, I was on my way to an interview and a gentleman struck a conversation with me. He asked me why I was in the City and the moment I told him that I was here for an interview, he asked me ‘so you’re here for the security guard’s job?’ It was quite funny,” he recollects.\\n\\nHe adds that in the past, people didn’t know much about Assam and have asked “which country” he was from. One of the best aspects of the City is the weather, vouches Kishor. Babita’s family is from Assam but she grew up in Mumbai and says that compared to the humid climate of the metropolitan city, Bengaluru is a pleasant place to stay in. “It is the perfect place for anyone to settle down,” she says. Though Kishor hasn’t explored a lot in Bengaluru, he says there are many places around the City, for those\\nwho like to travel.\\n\\n“One can go to places like Nandi Hills, Kushalnagar from here. There are also plenty of getaway options,” he says.The couple miss their parents and home food, but they say that they have adjusted well to the City.\\n\\n“Since my father was with the defence sector, we would keep moving. I have stayed in Delhi, Gujarat, Manipur and Tripura, and I got used to the different festivals and people. I am not bound by cultural aspects. It was easy to fit in,” says Kishor. Babita adds that\\nhaving grown up away from her hometown, she is also used to adjusting to\\ndifferent cultures.',\n",
       "  'Daniel Portman, who plays the role of Podrick, the loyal squire to Tyrion Lannister in ‘Game of Thrones’, was in the City recently for ‘Bangalore Comic Con’ and thoroughly enjoyed his stay here. He finds the people of India warm, welcoming and hospitable.\\n\\n“Coming to India has been an amazing experience. I have been to other Comic Cons before but this one was just brilliant. It was all the more exciting to see a billboard of mine at the event,” he gushes as he signs autographs and poses for selfies with fans. The actor will soon be seen in the fifth season of the show. About Podrick, his character in the hugely popular series, he says, “I’m not similar to him in any way. I wish I was like him. If more people were like him, the world would have been a better place. I have learnt a lot from playing this role.\\u2008He is a selfless, loyal and good guy. I hope some of that rubbed off on me during the process.”\\n\\nHe adds further, “I started working in the series when I was 19 years old. It has been a humbling experience and working alongside great actors has made me a better actor, which is amazing.”Daniel says that his character adds a comic touch to the otherwise dark drama. According to him, “the strongest characters on the show are women. The women represented in the series are powerful, strong-willed and independent.”\\n\\n He feels that the show is a big hit as people can relate to it. “‘Game of Thrones’ has a lot more texture and detail compared to any other show. Although it is a fantasy tale, it’s the realistic aspect of it that appeals to the viewers. The relationships and characters are very realistic and relatable and that’s why it is a successful show. It seamlessly blends fantasy and real world.”\\n\\nThe most challenging aspect of playing Podrick was learning to communicate with the audience through his body language. “Though I didn’t have many lines in first two seasons, I was given a lot of screen time. I had to communicate to people with my mere presence and expressions which was an interesting challenge,” says the actor. Ask him about his upcoming projects and the Scottish actor says that he finished writing the script of his first film.\\n\\nAn adaptation of ‘Romeo and Juliet’, the project will be shot with an entirely Scottish cast. “My best friend and I came up with this idea two-and-a-half years ago. We had a clear idea of what we wanted to bring out. So the writing became quite easy. Now the real fun begins, which is the execution and I’m quite excited about that,” he sums up.',\n",

       "  'Some years ago, during an ‘India vs South Africa’ match, a City-based techie got hooked to the gentleman’s game when he watched Alan Donald bowl to Sanjay Manjrekar. “I have loved the sport ever since I heard the cheers in the stadium,” Manish Achuth recalls.\\n\\nA\\u2008proof of this passion sprung up early this month, when he was adjudged the winner of the third season of the cricket contest, ‘ESPN CricIQ’. Organised by ‘ESPN Cricinfo’, the contest for this season was launched in June and culminated on April 4. The techie has won himself an all-expenses paid trip to London for two to watch the second Ashes Test match at Lords Cricket Ground.\\n\\nManish had to break a number of nerve-wracking qualifying rounds which included an online round and a Google Hangout round before flying his way to success. The questions spanned right from the 1800s to the modern-day IPL. “The rounds mainly tested us about cricket history, literature and contemporary cricket. The final round included questions on modern cricket because the 2015 Cricket World Cup was going on,” he says.\\n\\nThe thirst for knowledge on cricket helped him throughout his journey as he was one of the finalists in the first season of this contest as well. It is not surprising that he is eagerly waiting for the next season of ‘CricIQ’.  “Each year, the competition gets tougher. The online rounds are really tough to crack because there are participants from all over the country.” This season encompassed five weeks of Power Play rounds, semi-final rounds, interspersed with special features such as ‘surprise hours’, where on-spot prizes could be won, ‘Net Practice’ for quizzers who needed to warm up before facing the real challenge, ‘Quizzer’s Den,’ a hangout for serious quizzers and a wild card entry for the finale.\\n\\nThe finale was hosted at St  Joseph’s s Auditorium in the City and was attended by ace bowler Lakshmipathy Balaji,  who handed over the awards and gift vouchers to the winners. Manish was at a loss for words when asked to describe his achievement.\\n \\n “I met people who I had never met before but we were all united because of our love for the sport. I can’t wait for July. I will be taking my mother for this trip and as neither of us have been to England before, we are surely going to have good time.” The ardent cricket fan agrees that Indian cricket has gone through tumultuous changes. “Despite the commercialisation of the game thanks to the Indian Premier League, there is a platform today for cricketers from small towns to shine. The presence of Bollywood in IPL has helped take the game to a new level. IPL has to be run like a business otherwise it won’t survive,” he says.  ',\n",
       "  \"Not many people run the risk of giving up a plush job to chase their passion. But Arun Bhat and Shreeram MV consciously decided to put their earnings into doing something that they liked — photography. They point out that the decision to get into it full-time was not easy. But the two have no regrets at all today.\\n\\nArun and Shreeram started pursuing their passion for photography separately. Being an avid traveller, Arun was interested in travel photography. He worked on various aspects of travel photography —  landscapes, architecture, people, culture and, occasionally, wildlife. Shreeram started off as a naturalist and a birdwatcher. He was drawn towards the camera as a documentation tool and quickly developed the passion to be a wildlife photographer. “We had met on a couple of trips and realised that our approaches to photography were fairly different, because of the different genres we specialised in. We learnt a lot from each other, not only in terms of photography techniques but also field skills,” explains Arun. He points out that this association sowed the seeds for ‘Darter Photography’ — a place where photographers of varied skills and experiences could travel and take pictures together, nurturing the art and techniques of photography through their interactions with each other.\\n\\nThe duo confess that opening a start-up was not easy. “We got a lot of support from our earliest travellers (many of whom still travel with us). Their timely feedback, helped us learn the ropes quickly and set standards that we follow to this day,” explains Shreeram. He recalls that they would go on travel photography tours, to places like Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti, Bhutan etc. “These are dream destinations for more travellers, with the added advantage of a dedicated photography group travelling with them,” he adds.\\n\\nTheir experiential wildlife photography tours have taken them to places like Western Ghats, Kutch and Andaman. “Wildlife photography in India is primarily focused on the big cats. For a country like India, this is like focussing on the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Our wildlife photography tours focussed mainly on experiencing the various habitats — from rainforests of Western Ghats to the deserts of Kutch and Rajasthan to the islands of Andaman,” states Arun.\\n\\n‘Darter Photography’ has people who are open to new experiences and learning through travel. The initial days were tough, recall Arun and Shreeram but now they’ve not only widened their network but learnt a great deal in the process. Of all their tours, The Himalayas holds a special significance for them both. “The place presents the best of travel and photographic opportunities, with the most challenging terrain. Ladakh is one of the places where we've visited both in summer and winter,” recollects Arun. Shreeram pitches in saying, “Pangong Tso Lake is another revelation — the deep blue waters of the summer are a sight to behold. And in winter, the lake freezes over. Even the waves look like they've been frozen beautifully.”\\n\\nThere are a lot of different kinds of people who join Arun and Shreeram on their photographic tours. “We've had people from aged between 10 and 75 years traveling with us. They could be students, doctors, engineers, homemakers, managers, entrepreneurs, CEOs, civil services officers, teachers and even servicemen from the armed forces,” they say.  And the one thing that binds them all is their common love for photography.\",\n",

The accident took place at the 90 degree-sharp junction of the St Andrews Road-Hill Road of Bandra-West locality – nearly 200 metres away from Galaxy Apartments, the residence of the actor. Salman, said to be under the influence of alcohol, dashed his white-coloured Toyata Land Cruiser Lexus on to the pavement near a laundry and American Express Bakery killing one and injuring four.\\n\\nWhen the accident took place, he said, the witnesses heard a “big bang”. “Several witnesses have seen the accused (Salman Khan) coming out from the right side of the car…all witnesses say that he and his friend Kaamal Khan ran away after the incident.\\nThe prosecutor pointed out that witness Francis Fernandes has testified before the court that Khan and his friend left in a car from the place of accident. “This has never been challenged,” he said.\\n\\nGharat said: “This witness (Ashok Singh) was not present…he is a liar…he has come forward for the accused now, whatever may be the reasons.”\\n\\nThe prosecutor went on to add after the accident he went to the Bandra police station, however, according to him he was asked to wait outside. “He said that he was not arrested and later Salman Khan was arrested in the morning. He had also said that there was a huge gathering of mediapersons outside the court and when he came out of the police station with Khan, their photographs were clicked…..at that stage, with such a grand opportunity, why he did not tell the media the truth,” he asked.\\n\\nGharat said that Singh has not provided any “natural evidence”,  and his replies were “not satisfactory” and he was “inconsistent” in his conduct. “His evidence needs to be rejected,” he said.\\n ',\n",

In fact, the witness intervened and said that he was a policeman and after that both Salman Khan and Kamaal Khan left,” he said.

The court had earlier rejected a similar plea of West Bengal ruling party Trinamool Congress.\\n\\nSolicitor General Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the CBI, urged the court to modify the May 9, 2014 order asking the investigating agency to take over the entire probe into chit fund scams in West Bengal, Odisha and Assam in which companies, including Saradha, allegedly duped investors of about Rs 10,000 crore.\\n\\nHe contended that it was not possible to take over the investigations in all cases due to the enormity of the scam. The CBI has taken over probe against the firms which have “paid up capital of Rs 50 lakh and there are minimum five FIRs against them” in connection with the offence, he submitted.\\n\\nKumar pointed out that the total number of cases taken over and under investigation by CBI in West Bengal was 146 for which 13 regular cases had been registered by the CBI while the number of cases not taken over by CBI was 393.\\n\\nThe agency has taken over all 87 cases in Odisha and registered 44 RCs, he said, adding that in Tripura also, it has taken over probe in all five cases. The total number of cases taken over and under investigation by the CBI in Assam was four RCs in five cases, he said.\\n\\nThe bench, however, noted that while the CBI was making a distinction between bigger companies and the smaller ones, this approach may create “hundred holes” in its investigation since those involved in smaller cases may get acquitted.\\n\\nThe court said that common depositors have been taken for a ride and the CBI needs to probe larger conspiracy. It also suggested that the investigating agency may ask West Bengal to constitute a team of policemen which will be at its disposal. It asked the agency to come out with acceptable suggestions to ensure effective investigation of such cases and posted the matter for hearing on April 27.\\n ',\n",

       "  'In a bid to prove that 2002 mishap involving Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was a hit-and-run case, the prosecution today told the trial court that the deposition of witnesses indicated the actor had run away after the incident and did not take the injured to hospital.\\n\\nKhan is accused of ramming his Land Cruiser SUV into a roadside bakery in suburban Bandra on September 28, 2002, killing one person and injuring four who were sleeping outside. The prosecution has also alleged he was drunk and was driving without a licence, a charge denied by the actor.\\n\\nSoon after the mishap occurred at a place close to the residence of Khan, an angry mob converged at the spot and some of them were holding rods while a few others had stones in their hands, said Prosecutor Pradeep Gharat in his final arguments while referring to evidence of a witness.\\n\\nKhan\\'s childhood friend and neighbour, Francis Fernandez, whom the actor fondly called as \"Commander\", asked the 49-year-old actor to leave in a car driven by his wife. Khan soon went away in that car, Gharat said while quoting the deposition of Khan\\'s friend.\\n\\nFernandez, who stays near the place where the mishap occurred, had come to the spot after hearing the commotion that followed the accident.\\n\\nGharat, while dwelling upon evidence of Fernandez, said Khan had called out \"Commander, save me\". The very next moment, Fernandez asked him to leave as he feared the mob, armed with rods and stones, might get violent and hit him.\\n\\n\"The actor ran away from the spot and did not help the victims by taking them to hospital\", said Gharat.\\n\\nHowever, in his statement under Section 313 of CrPC earlier, Khan denied that he ran away and told the court that he had instructed his driver Ashok Singh, who was driving the car at the relevant time, to inform police and take the injured to hospital. Khan said he was at the spot for about 15 minutes and then left on the advise of his friend.\\n\\nGharat argued that the conduct of Khan in this case needs to be analysed and interpreted as this proves the guilt of the accused.\\n\\n\"His conduct shows that he was driving the car and therefore he ran away without helping the accused.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the actor was exempted from appearing in the case for the day as he had to go to Udaipur for a film shoot. Khan came to the court in the morning but his lawyer moved an application seeking exemption. As the prosecution did not object, the court allowed his plea.\\nReferring to the allegation made by Khan in the court that the police had attempted to \"fix\" him in the case, Gharat said a witness had testified that police had come to the spot on the second and third days also after the mishap to make inquiries from the people about the crash.\\n\\n\"If police had to fix Khan as alleged by him, then why police had gone there in the next two days after the mishap to conduct investigation?\" he said.\\n\\nThe police was only doing its duty, he said and denied Khan\\'s allegation that he was falsely implicated.\\n\\nThe Prosecutor said some witnesses had testified in the court that there were only three persons in the car at the time of the mishap. They had said that first Salman got down from the right hand side of the car, followed by his police bodyguard Ravindra Patil and singer friend Kamal Khan. There is absolutely no reference to Khan\\'s driver, Ashok Singh, who had told the court that he, and not Khan, was driving the car.\\n\\nIf Singh was driving the car, the defence lawyer did not put suggestions to the witnesses during cross-examination to this effect. It only showed the story of Singh driving the car was cooked up at a later stage to save Khan, Gharat said.\\n\\nThe Prosecutor further said the car had a right hand drive position and Khan had got down from this side only. The witnesses in this case, who were injured and lying underneath the car, had heard people shouting \"Salman Khan get down\". If Khan was not driving, why should they ask him to come out of the car? said Gharat.\\n\\nThis is a direct evidence against the accused (Khan) and why the version of these witnesses should not be believed? said the Prosecutor.\\n\\nMoreover, these witnesses have not been confronted with a question that Singh, the fourth person, was also in the car and not just three persons as stated by them. The accused had an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses on these lines but he has chosen to keep quiet on this issue, said Gharat.\\n\\nAlso, there was no reason for Khan to go away from the spot without informing police or helping the injured, he said.\\n\\nHowever, the actor had earlier told the court that he had instructed his driver Singh to inform police about the mishap and take injured to hospital.\\n\\nWitnesses at J W Marriot hotel, where Khan had gone with others just before the mishap, had seen only three persons in the car -- the actor, his police bodyguard Patil and singer-friend Kamal, said Gharat. There is no mention of Khan\\'s driver Singh, the Prosecutor argued.\\n\\nAlso, witnesses at the mishap spot had seen the actor and two others but they had not mentioned Singh, the Prosecutor maintained.\\n\\nArguments by the prosecution would continue tomorrow in the court of Sessions Judge D W Deshpande.\\n\\nA fresh trial started after the earlier judge, a Magistrate, added the charge of `culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\' which attracts a prison sentence of up to ten years, and referred the case to the Sessions Court.\\n\\nThe earlier charge was `rash and negligent driving\\', for which the maximum jail term is two years.\\nThe prosecution examined witnesses to prove that before the mishap Khan had visited a bar with his friends, to substantiate the charge that he was drunk.\\n\\nIt alleged that he did not have a driving licence at the time of the accident and got one only in 2004. However, the actor contended that the licence he got in 2004 was not the first one obtained by him.\\n\\nThe prosecution also alleged Khan was driving rashly, relying upon the statement of his police bodyguard who had told the Magistrate he had asked the actor not to drive in a reckless manner, but the latter didn\\'t pay heed.\\n\\nPatil, an eyewitness, died during the earlier trial but his statement is part of record in the present proceedings. Khan has claimed that Patil could not have seen the accident as he was asleep in the car.\\n\\nBesides the charge of culpable homicide (section 304 part two), the actor is facing charges of causing death of one person by negligent driving (sec 279), causing hurt to persons by act endangering personal safety (sec 337) and causing damage to property (sec 427) under Indian Penal Code.\\n\\nHe is also facing charges under Motor Vehicles Act (driving without licence) and Bombay Prohibition Act (driving after consuming liquor)',\n",

       "  'The public speech, “I have a dream,” delivered by Martin Luther King Jr from the steps of Lincoln Memorial, became the defining moment in the American Civil Rights movement. The rhetoric and diction of King in articulating his dream of freedom to all coloured men paved the way for the emancipation of the coloured race from slavery.\\n Experts later wrote about this speech, “With a single phrase, Martin Luther King Jr joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who’ve shaped modern America.” It is no wonder then, that this speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address. What is a wonder, however, is the fact that the seed of freedom for the coloured people was sown basically from “a dream”.  As author W R Bowie rightly observed, “The mightiest works have been accomplished by men who have kept their ability to dream great dreams.”\\nGreat accomplishments thus always follow great dreams. In 1961, President John F Kennedy made public his dream of sending a man safely to the moon by the turn of the decade. This gigantic dream would soon become “one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind” when on July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin Jr landed on the moon creating history.\\nDreams have pushed ordinary men from all walks of life to embrace lofty goals and achieve unparalleled success. President Woodrow Wilson emphasised this truth as he said, “We grow great by dreams. All big men are dreamers. They see things in the soft haze of a spring day or in the red fire of a long winter’s evening. They nourish them, nurse them through bad days till they bring them to the sunshine and light.”\\nCivilisation and much progress have all been the result of the dreamers of the human race. The father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, has often declared, “I am a dreamer. I am, indeed, a practical dreamer.” A very telling statement by a man whose pivotal role in the fight for freedom won for the people of our co-untry our dignity and liberty.\\nBeing a dreamer has always led men, tied down in a world of enforced duty and repetitive action to go beyond the motions of the day to reach great heights. John Grisham, the popular author of legal thrillers, while working as a lawyer for 60-70 hours a week, dreamt of writing novels. This dream propelled him to squeeze time before going to work and during courtroom recesses to pen his novels. Victor Hugo was right when he remarked, “There is nothing like a dream to create the future.”',\n",
       "  'It was in July last year that 46 Keralite nurses freed from Islamic State (IS) captivity in war-hit Iraq arrived in Kochi to a cheery welcome. Nine months later, the Non-Resident Keralite Affairs (NORKA) Department is busy coordinating efforts to rehabilitate new batches of evacuees fleeing strife-torn Yemen. During the nine months, the government held a series of meetings on employment and other benefits for those who were left jobless; the crisis in Libya also meant more expatriates returning home.\\n\\nThe NORKA Department officials state that recruitment of the returned expatriates is in “various stages”. The response from the returnees, so far, has been familiar – despite feelers from employers in the state and other parts of the country, it’s the overseas job that continues to be the big draw. For many nurses and workers in some of the unorganised sectors, better wages and the promise of a better life outweigh the potential risks of employment in countries even vulnerable to political unrest. On return, while still grappling with the horrors of life in heavily-bombed towns, they did say “never again”. For most of them, however, settling down at home is an indulgence they cannot afford.\\n\\nShanty P John, a 26-year-old nurse from Idukki who returned from Iraq, found a job in Abu Dhabi and moved out, barely four months after she came back. Shanthamma, her mother, says only a job outside of the country could have helped the family face its financial liabilities. “There are loans to repay and other financial issues to be settled; we didn’t have much of a choice,” she says. Shanty’s husband is employed in Jordan. For the family, it’s a struggle with no let-up for at least a couple of years – “till things are settled” – and a life together will have to wait.\\n\\nAccording to a 2013 survey conducted by the NORKA Department along with the Bureau of Economics and Statistics, there are about 1.6 million expatriates from Kerala living across the world. An estimated 50 lakh people in Kerala depend on the state’s expatriates. About 90 per cent of these expatriates are based in the Gulf region with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia topping the list with 35 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.\\n\\nThe Gulf boom, that in many ways defined Kerala’s changing social spaces in the 1970s and 1980s, was also propelled by people who left home for a better life. Experts in labour migration, however, feel that it’s time the Malayali expatriate looked within and realised that such hard-earned financial stability also came at a price.\\n\\nEvacuees from Iraq, Libya and Yemen narrate tales of recruitment frauds and pending salaries from employers who also refuse to release employees’ passports and travel documents when there is unrest in that country. Many had paid lakhs of rupees to recruitment agencies and middlemen to secure jobs in the Gulf. For them, it takes more than six months to “recover” the money and truly start earning.\\n\\nS Irudaya Rajan, Professor at Centre for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram and author of publications on labour migration from Kerala to the Gulf, says the debate has to factor in the impact of what he calls the ‘social cost’ of migration. “Economic motives are the most critical factor in migration. They leave families and travel far to make money but how much do they sacrifice till they achieve what they set out for? That’s the question we need to ask ourselves. Economic benefits can be measured but not the social cost of migration,” says Rajan. Of the about 1.4 million employed expatriates from Kerala, more than nine lakh (63 per cent) live away from their families.  \\n\\nNurses prefer Gulf\\nPolitical and civil unrest in countries including Yemen has, again, turned the spotlight on nurses and their struggles. The Centre, in an effort to check fraud in recruitment of nurses for overseas jobs, has also picked two government agencies – NORKA and the Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Council – as the only agencies authorised to conduct such recruitment. But nurses are not the whole story. The NORKA Department, in its survey, puts the figure of expatriates employed as “other workers” – a category apart from doctors, nurses, engineers, banking professionals, IT professionals, teachers, managers, drivers, businessmen and salesmen – at about eight lakh. The number of nurses stands at about 90,000.\\n\\nNORKA-ROOTS, the Department’s field agency, anchors self-employment programmes for emigrants who have returned. The focus now, however, is to cushion the impact of returning expatriates by finding them employment in partnership with private companies.\\nR S Kannan, CEO, NORKA-ROOTS, says since July, 2014, about 500 people were interviewed, 300 of them short-listed and 40 employed. “The nurses prefer the Gulf region because of better salaries and working conditions. They have difficulties in returning home when there is a crisis, like in Iraq or Yemen. But the employers could also be acting unprofessionally because of fears that the health sector in that country could be affected by mass evacuation of nurses,” says Kannan.\\n\\nShruthi Sasikumar of Puthupally in Kottayam district is one of the nurses who was freed from Iraq. She has found a job in a private hospital in Kochi but the family is also awaiting a call from potential employers in Qatar. Sasikumar, Shruthi’s father, says she has the qualifications and would wait for the right opening. “Obviously, we are not going to let her go to war zones again but she has to move on. She can’t do much with about Rs 12,000 a month,” he says.',\n",
       "  'Food safety, the World Health Organisation’s theme of the World Health Day 2015, is an issue of growing public health concern and, therefore, timely indeed. It has brought attention to pertinent questions: What is in your meal? Where did the ingredients come from? Were they properly and safely handled at every stage, from farm to plate? The objective of the World Health Day this year is to catalyse collective government and public action to put measures in place that will improve safety of food by aligning policies in agriculture, trade, health, education and social protection to provide a safe and healthy diet for all.\\n\\nFoodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal illnesses kill an estimated 2.2 million people every year globally, most of whom are children. Unsafe food, containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances, causes more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. Food safety hazards arise from harmful agricultural practices, poor hygiene at all stages of the food chain, lack of preventive controls in food processing operations, misuse of chemicals, contaminated inputs or inappropriate storage.\\nIn India, the full burden of foodborne illnesses is not known; most foodborne illnesses go unreported. Surveillance data in the country from 2011 -14 shows that foodborne outbreaks, together with acute diarrhoeal diseases, constituted nearly half of all reported outbreaks during this period. Although, there are many factors contributing to diarrhoea, simple interventions like washing hands with soap can reduce the risk of diarrhoeal diseases by 42-47 per cent.\\n\\nIndia has the second largest human population and one of the world’s greatest densities of tropical livestock. It possesses a favourable environment for the transmission of both, known and novel diseases between animals and people. Recent data on the foodborne micro-organisms in India has seen outbreaks of eight organisms of emerging and re-emerging diseases and six of these are of zoonotic origin. Thus, collaboration and strengthening surveillance in both, the animal and human health sectors, recognises the importance for comprehensively addressing the health risks at animal-human interface.\\nUse of pesticides and fertilisers in the past 50 years have grown nearly 170 times. Consequently, persistent residues of these chemicals contaminate food and disperse in the environment and find their way into the food chain.\\nIn India, food safety has obvious and direct linkages with the Swachh Bharat initiative of the prime minister that promotes cleanliness and hygiene, which are the key factors influencing food safety, thereby reducing the socio-economic impact of foodborne illnesses. Food safety also has linkages with the ‘Make in India’ campaign of the government to realise India’s huge potential in the export of high value agricultural produce-higher domestic standards for food safety and compliance can reduce the market risk.\\n\\nThe Government of India reaches nearly 200 million beneficiaries through the nation-wide food supplementation programmes like midday meals and supplementary nutrition programme of Integrated Child Development Services scheme. The public distribution system supplies grains to populations below poverty line. These programmes may harm beneficiaries in cases of gaps in food safety and control system.\\n\\nStreet food culture\\n\\nThe country has a thriving street food culture. While it may be the least expensive and most accessible food, street food also carries some risk. Fair licensing and inspections, combined with educational drives, are the best long-term measures to safeguard the public.\\nBy enacting Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, India consolidated various laws relating to food and established the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for laying down science-based food standards.\\n\\nAt the same time, agriculture sector needs to ensure the safety of the produce that arrives in the market as per the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) guidelines and Codex recommendations. On this World Health Day, let us commit to working together for making our food safe, leading to better health of the people of India.\\n\\n(The writer is WHO Representative in India)',\n",
       "  'As darkness crept into our sprawling home in Poonamallee, my grandpa, who spearheaded the housekeeping, ordered me to light the various kerosene lamps. Our tiled house had no electricity.\\n\\nI entered the dark lumber room with a darker mood. After clapping my hands noisily to drive the menacing scorpions away, I surveyed the lighting paraphernalia of kerosene can, bottles, funnels, wicks and lamps with a sinking heart bemoaning the plight of a child labour.\\n\\nSquatting on my haunches, I pulled the first grimy hurricane lamp, its glass blackened with soot, and started rubbing it vigorously with the cloth which was once a part of my shirt. “What if this lamp turned out to be like Aladdin’s, and a genie appeared and begged me to ask whatever I wanted?” I fantasised. I mentally drew up a wish list just in case.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the menacing cane in my grumpy math teacher’s hand should suddenly turn into a hissing serpent making him gibber hysterically.  Secondly, whenever I purloin fresh laddus or Mysore paks from the pantry and stuffed them into my mouth, my snooping grandpa should not catch me and try to pluck my ear in toto from its moorings. Thirdly, whenever I come in view of Pushpa, the girl with double plaits, who always tosses a coyish smile at me, my half trouser should transform into a full pant giving me the look of an adult.\\n\\nIt was time now to light the lamps.  Gingerly, I struck a match. The flame rose like a multi-coloured bud. I lighted the first lamp and went for the rest using a rolled piece of paper. To my surprise, my grim grandpa, who had entered the scene noiselessly, patted my back. Next day, he gave me a brand new tennis ball commending the tightfisted economy I adopted in the task of lighting all the lamps using only one match stick. In his brief citation he also mentioned, “Besides, with such inflammable material available, he did not start a raging fire and burn half of Poonamallee like Hanuman did in Lanka.”\\n\\nThe dark genie with bulging eyes and a corrugated tail did, after all, appear in my dream the next night. “I’m your slave. Whatever you want, command me,” he begged, hands folded on his bulging chest. I thought hard and hard and demanded. “Electrify our home. If so done, I will switch on the electric light in the dark lumber room and light all the kerosene lamps. And switch the electric light off.” Thomas Alva Edison would have turned in his grave.',\n",
       "  'There is no known law or rule that bans the use of mobile phones by students on the campuses of schools and colleges. But there is a de facto ban and students can carry mobiles risking their confiscation or getting fined. A Karnataka state legislature committee and a women and child welfare committee had favoured a ban, but it is at best only a recommendation. The rationale for the school and college authorities taking an absent rule and students’ mobiles in their hands is wrong and unconvincing. The argument is that it is not safe for girls to use mobile phones, as they lead to a rise in crimes against women, including rape.  The legislature committee had thought so, and the women’s committee saw another problem too: students would get addicted to social media. None of this bears scrutiny, and the ban would actually do harm to students.  \\n\\nThe recent case of the murder of a female student by an attender at the Pragathi College in Bengaluru shows how the ban can give rise to a situation which can lead to murder. The girl and others in the hostel were dependent on the attender for communication with their parents as they were not allowed to carry their mobiles. The problem between the girl and the attender, which is believed to have led to the murder, arose from this situation. The inability to use a mobile phone actually made her vulnerable. Mobile phones are tools of empowerment for women and other sections which are socially vulnerable. They are safety devices too, as shown by many women who have had to cope with unwelcome situations in their daily lives in workplaces, on the street and elsewhere. They cannot give any disadvantage to students on the campus. The argument that it poses a danger to girl students is misinformed. Actually it might enhance their safety.\\n\\nParents want to be in touch with their children, especially daughters. The students might also want to freely talk to their parents. The mobile phone facilitates this. It a part of everybody’s lives now. To ban its use on campuses on the basis of assumptions and prejudices is wrong. Mobiles, however, need to be switched off in class rooms, laboratories, libraries or assemblies in schools and colleges. It is also being retrograde to assume that students are unable to handle their mobile phones with maturity. If there is a policy or rule that bans their use on campuses, it should be withdrawn.',\n",
       "  'The Narendra Modi government’s move to block the mobile taxi-hailing apps of Uber, Ola and TaxiforSure is myopic in the extreme. These apps, which have revolutionised the way taxis are hired, are today being used by thousands of people across the country. In most of these cases, people owning cars now prefer to keep their vehicles behind and instead use these app-based services which fulfill a dire need in urban commute. Not just commuters, drivers in the app-based network too have never had it so good and the services are proving to be a life-changer for many.\\n\\nThe government’s rationale for restricting these app-based taxi services stems from the attempted rape by a Uber driver in Delhi a few months ago. However, since that unfortunate event, the app-bases services, also called aggregators, have moved swiftly to incorporate security features in the apps besides making punishments stringent for taxi drivers in their network even for minor infringements. Another reason for blocking the apps nationwide seems laughable – just because the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) was unable to block Delhi alone, it has suggested that the entire country be roped in. The government’s hard-nosed view of the entire app-based taxi services is surprising as it flies in the face of its stated position to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the information technology sector.\\n\\nThe app-based taxi services, which have, in fact, taken the world by storm, is the latest example of what mobile and Internet-based technologies can achieve. If the officials in the government, especially the transport department, are unable to comprehend the working of the app-based taxi services due to their technological illiteracy, it would be better for them to set up a committee of people who are Internet savvy.  This committee can constructively go into whatever issues are bugging the government and come up with workable solutions – all this without disturbing the operations of the taxi services. There have been incidents of rape and assault in conventional taxis, public transport buses, auto-rickshaws, and on trains. Has the government banned all these services as they have proved unsafe? The hounding of the app-based taxi services opens up suspicion that the powerful and entrenched conventional transport lobby may be behind these moves as they are the only ones adversely affected by the success of Uber and the rest. If the government goes ahead and blocks the mobile taxi hailing apps, it will only confirm the fast-gaining view that the Modi-led BJP government has a proclivity to come hard on anything that seems contentious instead of thinking through and coming up with solutions.',\n",

Whereas a win for Mumbaikars will take them to the fifth spot. So, the Blues will have to be on the top of their game as a win will be a must to keep up the pressure on the leaders.\\n\\n“It’s a must win situation for us. (Mohun) Bagan has not lost a game yet in the league, but we can’t rely on that for our succes. We have to play to our best potential and see were we end.

Joshua Walker and Eugenson Lyngdho could make up the midfield, while the third spot will a battle between Thoi Singh, Shankar Sampingiraj and Beokhokhei Bengaicho.\\n\\nMumbai has come on the back of a humiliating 0-6 defeat at the hands of Lajong at the Cooperage grounds on Friday. Khalid Jamil, their coach, sounded cautious about his sides’ chances against the champions. “It will be a tough task to get the better of Bengaluru. We come into the game after a poor show against Lajong. It was bad and not a place I would want my team to be in. There are few things that went wrong then, but we are prepared and want to correct them. Dwelling on the past is not what we need. We had a good run in between and we want to get back to our best immediately,” he said.\\n\\nJamil confirmed that their Japanese recruit Taisuke Matsugae and forward Abhishek Yadav will have to clear a fitness test ahead of the tie, making them doubtful for the game.\",\n",

The injury went undetected in the initial stages, but he had to undergo a knee surgery when the doctors with the India U-19 team eventually found out about it.  He resumed career with the Arrows in 2011, before eventually shifting to BFC in 2015. He rated the move as one of the best decisions of his career. “It has been a journey to cherish. Starting with the India U-16 side and then moving on with HASC before landing here with BFC. Playing professional football was a dream and I am happy that today I am living my dream,” he stated.\\n\\nPlaying under Ashley Westwood has also helped him develop and take his game to a new level. “Playing under Ashley has aided my game in many ways. He has played me in different positions. Starting with the right-back role to making me an attacking midfielder. This has helped me to grow as a player and adapt to the new role,” said the midfielder.',\n",

Those registering after three years will get lesser rate for the power sold.\\n\\nHowever, the flip side to the scheme is that consumers will end up bearing the brunt of the expenditure incurred by the Escoms while purchasing solar power, with the energy supply companies filing for tariff revisions every year.',\n",

While the Scheduled Castes and Tribes have been placed in columns B and C, respectively, other castes have been put in column A.\\n\\nThe exercise, concluding on April 30, will cover the socio-economic and educational status of the citizens of Karnataka.\\n\\n“It is not mandatory to answer all the questions in the census form, but it is the residents’ duty to do so. People who provide false information about caste, based on bogus certificates, could face serious action,” said Kantharaj.\\n\\nHe said the government improved upon the existing list every 10 years so that it could formulate welfare policies better. He, however, clarified that the socio-economic census was not meant to restrict the legitimate benefits to the backward communities. He ruled out the possibility of including any new community in the category of ‘untouchables’. “The government has taken various steps to eradicate intouchability,” Kantharaj said.\\n20 minutes at each house\\n\\nKantharaj said the enumerators had been trained to complete the census in 20 minutes in each house.\\n\\n“Previously, the survey would take at least 40 minutes. Now, most people have enough data and records with them and that will make it easy for the enumerators to get the desired information quickly,” said Kantharaj.',\n",

Hundreds of truckloads of sand is being transported to Bengaluru every day,” Siddaraju said.\\n\\nHe said there were sand deposits near Kyashavara in Koratagere taluk, Kodigenahalli in Madhugiri, Thimmanahalli in Pavagad and Heruru in Sira taluk.\\n\\nThe legislators of these regions are refusing to part with the sand for other areas. Hence, the deputy commissioner has been saying the sand deposits here could not be auctioned, he claimed.\\n\\n“The deputy commissioner had imposed several conditions for sand-transporting trucks. We were asked to display the board ‘sand truck’ on the vehicle and paint the truck with a distinct colour.\\u2008The trucks were also asked to instal GPS. But, despite meeting all these conditions, the sand blocks have not been auctioned. Hence, it became inevitable to transport sand by purchasing it from farmers,” Siddaraju said.\\n\\nHe demanded that theft cases should not be registered against sand transporting trucks and they should be let off after collecting fine. He warned that the transportation of construction material such as bricks, cement and iron would be stopped from Wednesday, if the Association’s demands were not met.\\n\\nGovt employees involved\\n\\nThe other office-bearers of the Association, including vice president Maruthi, said some police constables were into sand transporting business and that 30 to 35 trucks used for sand transporting were owned by government employees. He said the highest quantity of sand was being mined in Sira, Madhugiri and Koratagere. The sand so mined is being transported to builders in Bengaluru via Dobbspet and Kyatsandra, they said.\\n\\n“Money being collected through the Revenue department is not filling the government’s coffer. Instead, it is reaching the pockets of officials and politicians. Vested interests are making efforts to tighten their hold on the sand mafia by booking theft cases against truck owners,” the office-bearers said.\\nThe tractor owners sought to know why the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police were not visiting Kuruval village in Urdigere hobli of Tumakuru taluk.\\n\\n“Filter sand mafia holds a sway on this village. The village with 300 houses has more than 150 trucks and tractors. But not a single official has visited the village till now,” the office-bearers said.',\n",
